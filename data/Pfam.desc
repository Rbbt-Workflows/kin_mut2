DE   C-terminal domain of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin
CC   This is the C-terminal domain of 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-cysPrx),
CC   a member of the peroxiredoxin superfamily which protect cells
CC   against membrane oxidation through glutathione (GSH)-dependent
CC   reduction of phospholipid hydroperoxides to corresponding
CC   alcohols [1]. The C-terminal domain is crucial for providing the
CC   extra cysteine necessary for dimerisation of the whole molecule.
CC   Loss of the enzyme's peroxidase activity is associated with
CC   oxidation of the catalytic cysteine, upstream of this domain;
CC   and glutathionylation, presumably through its disruption of
CC   protein structure, facilitates access for GSH, resulting in
CC   spontaneous reduction of the mixed disulfide to the sulfhydryl
CC   and consequent activation of the enzyme [2].	The domain is

DE   Adipokinetic hormone
CC   This family consists of several insect adipokinetic hormone as

CC   provides an attractive model system to study the hormonal
CC   regulation of metabolism during physical exercise. In
CC   long-distance flying insects, such as the migratory locust, both

DE   S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase leader peptide
CC   This family consists of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine
CC   decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) leader peptides. AdoMetDC is a key
CC   regulatory enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyamines. All
CC   expressed plant AdoMetDC mRNA 5' leader sequences contain a

CC   This family consists of several archaebacterial
CC   S-adenosylmethionine synthetase C(AdoMet synthetase or MAT) (EC
CC   2.5.1.6). S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) occupies a central role
CC   in the metabolism of all cells. The biological roles of AdoMet
CC   include acting as the primary methyl group donor, as a precursor
CC   to the polyamines, and as a progenitor of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl
CC   radical. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyses the only
CC   known route of AdoMet biosynthesis. The synthetic process occurs
CC   in a unique reaction in which the complete triphosphate chain is

CC   fruiting bodies. It has been suggested that these haemolysins
CC   play an important role in initial phase of fungal fruiting. The
CC   bacterial members of this family are expressed during
CC   sporulation [1].  Ostreolysin was found cytolytic to various
CC   erythrocytes and tumour cells [2]. It forms transmembrane pores
CC   4 nm in diameter. The activity is inhibited by total membrane
CC   lipids, and modulated by lysophosphatides. The potential use of

AC   PF07792.6
DE   Docking domain of Afi1 for Arf3 in vesicle trafficking
CC   This domain occurs at the N-terminal of Afi1, a protein
CC   necessary for vesicle trafficking in yeast. This domain is the
CC   interacting region of the protein which binds to Arf3. Afi1 is
CC   distributed asymmetrically at the plasma membrane and is
CC   required for polarized distribution of Arf3 but not of an Arf3
CC   guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, Yel1p. However, Afi1 is not
CC   required for targeting of Arf3 or Yel1p to the plasma membrane.
CC   Afi1 functions as an Arf3 polarization-specific adapter and
CC   participates in development of polarity. Although Arf3 is the
CC   homologue of human Arf6 it does not function in the same way,
CC   not being necessary for endocytosis or for mating factor
CC   receptor internalisation. In the S phase, however, it is
CC   concentrated at the plasma membrane of the emerging bud. Because
CC   of its polarized localisation and its critical function in the
CC   normal budding pattern of yeast, Arf3 is probably a regulator of
CC   vesicle trafficking, which is important for polarized growth.

DE   Accessory gene regulator B
CC   The arg locus consists of two transcripts: RNAII and RNAIII.
CC   RNAII encodes four genes (agrA, B, C, and D) whose gene products
CC   assemble a quorum sensing system.  AgrB and AgrD are essential
CC   for the production of the autoinducing peptide which functions
CC   as a signal for quorum sensing.  AgrB is a transmembrane protein
CC   [1].
AC   PF05931.5
DE   Staphylococcal AgrD protein
CC   This family consists of several AgrD proteins from many
CC   Staphylococcus species. The agr locus was initially described in
CC   Staphylococcus aureus as an element controlling the production
CC   of exoproteins implicated in virulence. Its pattern of action
CC   has been shown to be complex, upregulating certain extracellular
CC   toxins and enzymes expressed post-exponentially and repressing
CC   some exponential-phase surface components. AgrD encodes the
CC   precursor of the autoinducing peptide (AIP).The AIP derived from
CC   AgrD by the action of AgrB interacts with AgrC in the membrane
CC   to activate AgrA, which upregulates transcription both from
CC   promoter P2, amplifying the response, and from P3, initiating
CC   the production of a novel effector: RNAIII. In S. aureus,
CC   delta-hemolysin is the only translation product of RNA III and
CC   is not involved in the regulatory functions of the transcript,
CC   which is therefore the primary agent for modulating the
CC   expression of other operons controlled by agr [1].

CC   alpha-glucosyltransferase (AGT) and the inverting
CC   beta-glucosyltransferase (BGT). The proteins in this family are
CC   AGT. AGT adopts the GT-B fold and binds both the sugar donor and

CC   activity [1]. It is probably a general upregulator of Hsp90
CC   function, particularly contributing to its efficiency in
CC   conditions of increased stress [2]. p38 is also known to
CC   interact with the cytoplasmic domain of the VSV G protein, and

CC   complex is a multiprotein subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
CC   that controls segregation of chromosomes and exit from mitosis
CC   in eukaryotes [1, 2]. The protein members of this family contain
CC   TPR repeats just as those of Apc7 do, and it appears that these

CC   the long domain downstream of the WD40 repeat/s that are present
CC   on the Apc4 subunits. The anaphase-promoting complex is a
CC   multiprotein subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that controls
CC   segregation of chromosomes and exit from mitosis in eukaryotes
CC   [1,2]. Results in C.elegans show that the primary essential role
CC   of the spindle assembly checkpoint is not in the chromosome
CC   segregation process itself but rather in delaying anaphase onset
CC   until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle.  the
CC   APC/C is likely to be required for all metaphase-to-anaphase
CC   transitions in a multicellular organism [3].

DE   Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5
CC   Apc5 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome
CC   (APC/C) which is a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase that mediates
CC   the proteolysis of cell cycle proteins in mitosis and G1.  Apc5,
CC   although it does not harbour a classical RNA binding domain,
CC   Apc5 binds the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which directly
CC   binds the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of growth factor 2
CC   mRNA. PABP was found to enhance IRES-mediated translation,
CC   whereas Apc5 over-expression counteracted this effect. In
CC   addition to its association with the APC/C complex, Apc5 binds
CC   much heavier complexes and co-sediments with the ribosomal
CC   fraction [1,2]. The N-terminus of Afi1 serves to stabilise the

AC   PF10471.3
DE   Anaphase-promoting complex APC subunit 1
CC   The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome is a cell
CC   cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates
CC   important events in mitosis such as the initiation of anaphase
CC   and exit from telophase. The APC, in conjunction with other
CC   enzymes, assembles multi-ubiquitin chains on a variety of
CC   regulatory proteins thereby targeting them for proteolysis by
CC   the 26S proteasome. CDC26 is one of the nine or so subunits
CC   identified within APC but its exact function is not known [1].
CC   The APC/C becomes active at the metaphase/anaphase transition
CC   and remains active during G1 phase. One mechanism linked to
CC   activation of the APC/C is phosphorylation.  The yeast APC/C is
CC   composed of at least 13 subunits, but the function of many of
CC   the subunits is unknown. Hcn1 is the smallest subunit of the S.
CC   pombe APC/C, and is found to be essential for cell viability,
CC   APC/C integrity, and proper APC/C regulation. In addition, Hcn1
CC   phosphorylation indicates a specific role for the
CC   phosphorylation of this subunit late in the cell cycle [2].

CC   they include: aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase or kanamycin
CC   kinase / neomycin-kanamycin phosphotransferase and streptomycin
CC   3''-kinase or streptomycin 3''-phosphotransferase. The

DE   Aph-1 protein
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic Aph-1
CC   proteins.Gamma-secretase catalyses the intramembrane proteolysis
CC   of Notch, beta-amyloid precursor protein, and other substrates
CC   as part of a new signaling paradigm and as a key step in the
CC   pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It is thought that the
CC   presenilin heterodimer comprises the catalytic site and that a
CC   highly glycosylated form of nicastrin associates with it. Aph-1
CC   and Pen-2, two membrane proteins genetically linked to
CC   gamma-secretase, associate directly with presenilin and
CC   nicastrin in the active protease complex. Co-expression of all

CC   determiner in the honeybee. In the honeybee, the mechanism of
CC   sex determination depends on the csd gene which produces an

AC   PF05778.6
DE   Apolipoprotein CIII (Apo-CIII)
CC   This family consists of several mammalian apolipoprotein CIII
CC   (Apo-CIII) sequences. Apolipoprotein C-III is a 79-residue
CC   glycoprotein. It is synthesised in the intestine and liver as
CC   part of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and the high
CC   density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Owing to its positive
CC   correlation with plasma triglyceride (Tg) levels, Apo-CIII is
CC   suggested to play a role in Tg metabolism and is therefore of
CC   interest regarding atherosclerosis. However, unlike other
CC   apolipoproteins such as Apo-AI, Apo E or CII for which many
CC   naturally occurring mutations are known, the structure-function
CC   relationships of apo C-III remains a subject of debate. One
CC   possibility is that apo C-III inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
CC   activity, as shown by in vitro experiments. Another suggestion,
CC   is that elevated levels of Apo-CIII displace other
CC   apolipoproteins at the lipoprotein surface, modifying their
CC   clearance from plasma [1].

DE   Apovitellenin I (Apo-VLDL-II)
CC   This family consists of several avian apovitellenin I sequences.
CC   As part of the avian reproductive effort, large quantities of
CC   triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles
CC   are transported by receptor-mediated endocytosis into the female
CC   germ cells. Although the oocytes are surrounded by a layer of
CC   granulosa cells harbouring high levels of active lipoprotein
CC   lipase, non-lipolysed VLDL is transported into the yolk. This is
CC   because VLDL particles from laying chickens are protected from
CC   lipolysis by apolipoprotein (apo)-VLDL-II, a potent dimeric

CC   domain, while the C-terminal domain is a pseudocatalyitc domain.
CC   More specifically, the catalytic domain is a zinc dependent
CC   deaminases domain and is essential for cytidine
CC   deamination.APOBEC-3 like members contain two copies of this
CC   domain.  This family also includes the functionally homologous
CC   activation induced deaminase, which is essential for the
CC   development of antibody diversity in B lymphocytes.  RNA editing

DE   Apolipoprotein C-I (ApoC-1)
CC   Apolipoprotein C-I (ApoC-1) is a water-soluble protein component

CC   acetyltransferase (LCAT), inhibits cholesteryl ester transfer
CC   protein, can inhibit hepatic lipase and phospholipase 2 and can
CC   stimulate cell growth. ApoC-1 delays the clearance of beta-VLDL

DE   E2 domain of amyloid precursor protein
CC   The E2 domain is the largest of the conserved domains of the
CC   amyloid precursor protein. The structure of E2 consists of two
CC   coiled-coil sub-structures connected through a continuous helix,
CC   and bears an unexpected resemblance to the spectrin family of
CC   protein structures.E 2 can reversibly dimerise in solution, and
CC   the dimerisation occurs along the longest dimension of the
CC   molecule in an antiparallel orientation, which enables the
CC   N-terminal substructure of one monomer to pack against the
CC   C-terminal substructure of a second monomer. The high degree of
CC   conservation of residues at the putative dimer interface
CC   suggests that the E2 dimer observed in the crystal could be
CC   physiologically relevant. Heparin sulfate proteoglycans, the
CC   putative ligands for the precursor present in extracellular
CC   matrix, bind to E2 at a conserved and positively charged site
CC   near the dimer interface [1].

CC   share the same amino acid sequence  Swiss:Q9ZFE7, but bind
CC   different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD' binds Fe2+. ARD and

CC   bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal
CC   ion.	The two enzymes share the same substrate,
CC   1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different
CC   products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine
CC   (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine
CC   salvage  pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to
CC   methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of

CC   protein, composed of six helical segments and intervening loops
CC   and turns, as well as a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif,
CC   although neither free anti-sigma factor nor anti-sigma factor
CC   bound to sigma-70 has been shown to interact directly with DNA.
CC   In solution, the protein forms a symmetric dimer of small (10.59

DE   Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer
CC   The family of bacterial Anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducers
CC   are likely to bind sugars or related metabolites. The entire
CC   protein is comprised of a single globular domain with an
CC   eight-stranded beta-sandwich fold. There are a few
CC   characteristics which define this beta-sandwich fold as being
CC   distinct from other so-named folds, and these are: 1) a well
CC   conserved tryptophan, usually following a polar residue, present
CC   at the start of the first strand; this tryptophan appears to be
CC   central to a hydrophobic interaction required to hold the two
CC   beta-sheets of the sandwich together, and 2) a nearly absolutely
CC   conserved asparagine located at the end of the second
CC   beta-strand, that hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of
CC   the residues 2 and 4 positions downstream from it, thereby
CC   stabilising the characteristic tight turn between strands 2 and

CC   the post-translational conjugation of arginine to the N terminus
CC   of a protein. In eukaryotes, this functions as part of the N-end

DE   Autophagy-related protein 11
CC   The function of this family is conflicting. In the fission
CC   yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, this protein has been shown to
CC   interact with the telomere cap complex [1,2]. However, in
CC   budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this protein is called
CC   ATG11 and is shown to be involved in autophagy [3].
AC   PF10033.3
DE   Autophagy-related protein 13
CC   Members of this family of phosphoproteins are involved in
CC   cytoplasm to vacuole transport (Cvt), and more specifically in
CC   Cvt vesicle formation. They are probably involved in the
CC   switching machinery regulating the conversion between the Cvt
CC   pathway and autophagy. Finally, ATG13 is also required for
CC   glycogen storage [1][2][3].
AC   PF10186.3
DE   UV radiation resistance protein and autophagy-related subunit 14
CC   The Atg14 or Apg14 proteins are hydrophilic proteins with a
CC   predicted molecular mass of 40.5 kDa, and have a coiled-coil
CC   motif at the N terminus region. Yeast cells with mutant Atg14
CC   are defective not only in autophagy but also in sorting of
CC   carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar-soluble hydrolase, to the
CC   vacuole. Subcellular fractionation indicate that Apg14p and
CC   Apg6p are peripherally associated with a membrane structure(s).
CC   Apg14p was co-immunoprecipitated with Apg6p, suggesting that
CC   they form a stable protein complex. These results imply that
CC   Apg6/Vps30p has two distinct functions: in the autophagic
CC   process and in the vacuolar protein sorting pathway. Apg14p may
CC   be a component specifically required for the function of
CC   Apg6/Vps30p through the autophagic pathway [1]. There are 17
CC   auto-phagosomal component proteins which are categorized into
CC   six functional units, one of which is the AS-PI3K complex
CC   (Vps30/Atg6 and Atg14). The AS-PI3K complex and the Atg2-Atg18
CC   complex are essential for nucleation, and the specific function
CC   of the AS-PI3K apparently is to produce phosphatidylinositol
CC   3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) at the pre-autophagosomal structure
CC   (PAS). The localisation of this complex at the PAS is controlled
CC   by Atg14 [2]. Autophagy mediates the cellular response to
CC   nutrient deprivation, protein aggregation, and pathogen invasion
CC   in humans, and malfunction of autophagy has been implicated in
CC   multiple human diseases including cancer. This effect seems to
CC   be mediated through direct interaction of the human Atg14 with
CC   Beclin 1 in the human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III
CC   complex [3].
AC   PF08614.5
DE   Autophagy protein 16 (ATG16)
CC   Autophagy is a ubiquitous intracellular degradation system for
CC   eukaryotic cells.		 During autophagy, cytoplasmic
CC   components are enclosed in autophagosomes and delivered to
CC   lysosomes/vacuoles. ATG16 (also known as Apg16) has been shown
CC   to be bind to Apg5 and is required for the function of the
CC   Apg12p-Apg5p conjugate in the yeast autophagy pathway [1].
AC   PF12744.1
DE   Autophagy protein Atg19, Atg8-binding
CC   Autophagy is generally known as a process involved in the
CC   degradation of bulk cytoplasmic components that are
CC   non-specifically sequestered into an autophagosome, where they
CC   are sequestered into double-membrane vesicles and delivered to
CC   the degradative organelle, the lysosome/vacuole, for breakdown
CC   and eventual recycling of the resulting macromolecules. In
CC   contrast to autophagy, however, the Cvt pathway is a highly
CC   selective process that involves the sequestration of at least
CC   two specific cargos that are resident vacuolar hydrolases,
CC   aminopeptidase I (Ape1) and alpha-mannosidase (Ams1). These
CC   proteins are sequestered within a double-membrane vesicle,
CC   termed a Cvt vesicle. The Cvt vesicle is fairly consistent in
CC   size, and is much smaller than the autophagosome, being 140-160
CC   nm in diameter. The prApe1 is sequestered within either Cvt
CC   vesicles or autophagosomes, depending on the nutrient
CC   conditions, and delivered to the vacuole. Autophagy and the Cvt
CC   pathway are topologically and mechanistically similar and share
CC   most of the same machinery. The Ape1 complex is ultimately
CC   enwrapped within either Cvt vesicles or autophagosomes at the
CC   perivacuolar PAS. The receptor protein Atg19 binds to the Ape1
CC   complex through the prApe1 propeptide to form the Cvt complex in
CC   the cytosol. In the absence of Atg19, prApe1 can form an Ape1
CC   complex, but does not localise at the PAS. Atg19 is a peripheral
CC   membrane protein with differing binding sites for both Ape1 and
CC   Ams1. The Atg8-binding region in the yeast proteins is this very
CC   C-terminal residues [3].

CC   Autophagy is generally known as a process involved in the

DE   Atrophin-1 family
CC   Atrophin-1 is the protein product of the
CC   dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene. DRPLA
CC   OMIM:125370 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is
CC   caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene on
CC   chromosome 12p. This results in an extended polyglutamine region
CC   in atrophin-1, that is thought to confer toxicity to the
CC   protein, possibly through altering its interactions with other
CC   proteins [1,2]. The expansion of a CAG repeat is also the
CC   underlying defect in six other neurodegenerative disorders,
CC   including Huntington's disease. One interaction of expanded
CC   polyglutamine repeats that is thought to be pathogenic is that
CC   with the short glutamine repeat in the transcriptional
CC   coactivator CREB binding protein, CBP. This interaction draws
CC   CBP away from its usual nuclear location to the expanded
CC   polyglutamine repeat protein aggregates that are characteristic
CC   of the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders. This
CC   interferes with CBP-mediated transcription and causes
CC   cytotoxicity [2].

DE   Autotransporter beta-domain
CC   Secretion of protein products occurs by a number of different
CC   pathways in bacteria.  One of these pathways known as the type V
CC   pathway was first described for the IgA1 protease [2]. The
CC   protein component that mediates secretion through the outer
CC   membrane is contained within the secreted protein itself, hence
CC   the proteins secreted in this way are called autotransporters.
CC   This family corresponds to the presumed integral membrane
CC   beta-barrel domain that transports the protein. This domain is
CC   found at the C terminus of the proteins it occurs in.  The N
CC   terminus contains the variable passenger domain that is
CC   translocated across the membrane.  Once the passenger domain is
CC   exported it is cleaved auto-catalytically in some proteins, in

DE   NADH-ubiquinone reductase complex 1 MLRQ subunit
CC   The MLRQ subunit of mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone reductase
CC   complex I is nuclear [1] and is found in plants [2], insects,
CC   fungi and higher metazoans [3]. It appears to act within the

DE   RNA binding protein B2
CC   B2 is expressed by the insect Flock House virus (FHV) as a
CC   counter-defense mechanism against antiviral RNA silencing during
CC   infection. In vitro, B2 binds to dsRNA as a dimer and inhibits
CC   the cleavage of it by Dicer. B2 blocks cleavage of the FHV
CC   genome by Dicer and also the incorporation of FHV small

DE   Beta2-adaptin appendage, C-terminal sub-domain
CC   Members of this family adopt a structure consisting of a 5
CC   stranded beta-sheet, flanked by one alpha helix on the outer
CC   side, and by two alpha helices on the inner side. This domain is
CC   required for binding to clathrin, and its subsequent
CC   polymerisation. Furthermore, a hydrophobic patch present in the

DE   Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory B subunit (B56 family)
CC   Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major intracellular protein
CC   phosphatase that regulates multiple aspects of cell growth and
CC   metabolism. The ability of this widely distributed
CC   heterotrimeric enzyme to act on a diverse array of substrates is
CC   largely controlled by the nature of its regulatory B subunit.
CC   There are multiple families of B subunits (See also
CC   Pfam:PF01240), this family is called the B56 family [1].

CC   The sequences found in this family are similar to the BA14K
CC   proteins expressed by Brucella abortus (Swiss:Q44701) and by
CC   Brucella suis (Swiss:Q8FVU0).  BA14K was found to be strongly
CC   immunoreactive; it induces both humoral and cellular responses
CC   in hosts throughout the infective process [1].
AC   PF06989.6
DE   BAALC N-terminus
CC   This family represents the N-terminal region of the mammalian
CC   BAALC proteins.    BAALC (brain and acute leukaemia,
CC   cytoplasmic), that is highly conserved among mammals but
CC   evidently absent from lower organisms. Two isoforms are
CC   specifically expressed in neuroectoderm-derived tissues, but not
CC   in tumours or cancer cell lines of non-neural tissue origin. It
CC   has been shown that blasts from a subset of patients with acute
CC   leukaemia greatly overexpress eight different BAALC transcripts,
CC   resulting in five protein isoforms.  Among patients with acute
CC   myeloid leukaemia, those overexpressing BAALC show distinctly
CC   poor prognosis, pointing to a key role of the BAALC products in
CC   leukaemia. It has been suggested that BAALC is a gene implicated
CC   in both neuroectodermal and hematopoietic cell functions [1].

CC   N-acetyltransferases (BAAT).
AC   PF02673.12
DE   Bacitracin resistance protein BacA
CC   Bacitracin resistance protein (BacA) is a putative undecaprenol
CC   kinase. BacA confers resistance to bacitracin, probably by
CC   phosphorylation of undecaprenol [1].
AC   PF05791.5
DE   Bacillus haemolytic enterotoxin (HBL)
CC   This family consists of several Bacillus haemolytic enterotoxins
CC   (HblC, HblD, HblA, NheA, and NheB) which can cause food
CC   poisoning in humans [1].
AC   PF05968.5
DE   Bacillus PapR protein
CC   This family consists of the Bacillus species specific PapR
CC   protein. The papR gene belongs to the PlcR regulon and is
CC   located 70 bp downstream from plcR. It encodes a 48-amino-acid
CC   peptide. Disruption of the papR gene abolishes expression of the
CC   PlcR regulon, resulting in a large decrease in haemolysis and
CC   virulence in insect larvae. A processed form of PapR activates
CC   the PlcR regulon by allowing PlcR to bind to its DNA target.
CC   This activating mechanism is strain specific [1].
AC   PF07707.9
DE   BTB And C-terminal Kelch
CC   This domain is found associated with Pfam:PF00651 and
CC   Pfam:PF01344 [1]. The BACK domain is found juxtaposed to the BTB
CC   domain; they are  separated by as little as two residues [1]. 
CC   This family appears to be closely related to the BTB domain
CC   (Finn RD, personal observation).
AC   PF13004.1
DE   Bacteroidetes-Associated Carbohydrate-binding Often N-terminal
CC   The BACON (Bacteroidetes-Associated Carbohydrate-binding Often
CC   N-terminal) domain is an all-beta domain found in diverse
CC   architectures, principally in combination with
CC   carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteases. These architectures
CC   suggest a carbohydrate-binding function which is also supported
CC   by the nature of BACON's few conserved amino-acids. The phyletic
CC   distribution of BACON and other data tentatively suggest that it
CC   may frequently function to bind mucin.
AC   PF10432.3
DE   Bacterial phospho-glucose isomerase C-terminal region
CC   This is the C-terminal half of a bacterial phospho-glucose
CC   isomerase EC:5.3.1.9 protein which is similar to eukaryote
CC   homologues to the extent that the sequence includes the cluster
CC   of threonines and serines that forms the sugar phosphate-binding
CC   site in conventional PGI. This domain contributes a good
CC   proportion of the active catalytic site residues. This PGI uses
CC   the same catalytic mechanisms for both glucose ring-opening and
CC   isomerisation for the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate to
CC   fructose 6-phosphate [1]. It is associated with family SIS,
CC   Pfam:PF01380.
AC   PF12173.2
DE   Bacteriocin class IIc cyclic gassericin A-like
CC   This class of bacteriocins was previously described as class V.
CC   The members include gassericin A, acidocin B and butyrovibriocin
CC   AR10, all of which are hydrophobic cyclical structures [1]. The
CC   N- and C-termini are covalently linked, and the circular
CC   molecule is resistant to several proteases and peptidases [2].
CC   The immunity protein that protects Lactobacillus gasseri from
CC   the toxic effects of its bacteriocin, gassericin A, has been
CC   identified. It is found to be a small positively-charged
CC   hydrophobic peptide of 53 amino acids containing a putative
CC   transmembrane segment [3] - a structure unlike that of the more
CC   common immunity proteins as found in Pfam:PF08951.
AC   PF01721.12
DE   Class II bacteriocin
CC   The bacteriocins are small peptides that inhibit the growth of
CC   various bacteria. Bacteriocins of lactic acid  bacteria may
CC   inhibit their target cells by permeabilising the cell  membrane
CC   [1].
AC   PF10439.3
DE   Bacteriocin class II with double-glycine leader peptide
CC   This is a family of bacteriocidal bacteriocins secreted by
CC   Streptococcal species in order to kill off closely-related
CC   competitor Gram-positives. The sequence includes the peptide
CC   precursor, this being cleaved off proteolytically at the
CC   double-glycine. The family does not carry the YGNGVXC motif
CC   characteristic of pediocin-like Bacteriocins, Bacteriocin_II
CC   Pfam:PF01721. The producer bacteria are protected from the
CC   effects of their own bacteriocins by production of a specific
CC   immunity protein which is co-transcribed with the genes encoding
CC   the bacteriocins, eg family EntA_Immun Pfam:PF08951. The
CC   bacteriocins are structurally more specific than their
CC   immunity-protein counterparts. Typically, production of the
CC   bacteriocin gene is from within an operon carrying up to 6 genes
CC   including a typical two-component regulatory system (R and H), a
CC   small peptide pheromone (C), and a dedicated ABC transporter (A
CC   and -B) as well as an immunity protein [1]. The ABC transporter
CC   is thought to recognise the N termini of both the pheromone and
CC   the bacteriocins and to transport these peptides across the
CC   cytoplasmic membrane, concurrent with cleavage at the conserved
CC   double-glycine motif. Cleaved extracellular C can then bind to
CC   the sensor kinase, H, resulting in activation of R and
CC   up-regulation of the entire gene cluster via binding to
CC   consensus sequences within each promoter [2]. It seems likely
CC   that this whole regulon is carried on a transmissible plasmid
CC   which is passed between closely related Firmicute species since
CC   many clinical isolates from different Firmicutes can produce at
CC   least two bacteriocins. and the same bacteriocins can be
CC   produced by different species.
AC   PF09221.4
DE   Bacteriocin class IId cyclical uberolysin-like
CC   Members of this family are membrane-interacting peptides,
CC   produced by Enterococci that display a broad anti-microbial
CC   spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They
CC   adopt a helical structure, with five alpha helices forming a
CC   Saposin-like fold [2]. The structure has been found to be
CC   cyclical [1, 3]. It should be pointed out that one reference [4]
CC   implies that both circularin A and gassericin A are class V or
CC   IIc-type bacteriocins; however we find that these two proteins
CC   fall into different Pfam families families, this one and
CC   BacteriocIIc_cy, Pfam:PF12173.
AC   PF11758.2
DE   Aureocin-like type II bacteriocin
CC   This is a small family of type II bacteriocins usually encoded
CC   on a plasmid. Characteristically the members are small,
CC   cationic, rich in Lys and Try, and bring about a generalised
CC   membrane permeabilisation leading to leakage of ions. The family
CC   includes aureocin A, lacticins Q and Z, and BhtB as well as an
CC   archaeal member.
AC   PF04519.7
DE   Polymer-forming cytoskeletal
CC   This is a family of bactofilins, a functionally diverse class of
CC   cytoskeletal, polymer-forming, proteins that is widely conserved
CC   among bacteria. In the example species C. crescentus, two
CC   bactofilins assemble into a membrane-associated laminar
CC   structure that shows cell-cycle-dependent polar localisation and
CC   acts as a platform for the recruitment of a cell wall
CC   biosynthetic enzyme involved in polar morphogenesis. Bactofilins
CC   display distinct subcellular distributions and dynamics in
CC   different bacterial species, suggesting that they are versatile
CC   structural elements that have adopted a range of different
CC   cellular functions.

DE   Bacterial transglutaminase-like N-terminal region
CC   This region is found towards the N-terminus of various archaeal

DE   Baculovirus immediate-early protein (IE-0)
CC   The Autographa californica multinucleocapsid nuclear
CC   polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) ie-1 gene product (IE-1) is thought
CC   to play a central role in stimulating early viral transcription.
CC   IE-1 has been demonstrated to activate several early viral gene
CC   promoters and to negatively regulate the promoters of two other
CC   AcMNPV regulatory genes, ie-0 and ie-2. It is thought that that
CC   IE-1 negatively regulates the expression of certain genes by
CC   binding directly, or as part of a complex, to promoter regions

AC   PF03041.8
DE   lef-2
CC   The lef-2 gene (for late expression factor 2) from baculovirus
CC   is required for expression of late genes. This gene has been
CC   shown to be specifically required for expression from the vp39

DE   Nucleopolyhedrovirus late expression factor 3 (LEF-3)
CC   This family consists of LEF-3 Nucleopolyhedrovirus late
CC   expression factor 3 (LEF-3) sequences which are known to be
CC   ssDNA-binding proteins [1].  Alkaline nuclease (AN) and LEF-3
CC   may participate in homologous recombination of the baculovirus
CC   genome in a manner similar to that of exonuclease (Redalpha) and
CC   DNA-binding protein (Redbeta) of the Red-mediated homologous
CC   recombination system of bacteriophage lambda [2].		
CC   LEF-3 is essential for transporting the putative baculovirus
CC   helicase protein P143 into the nucleus where they function
CC   together during viral DNA replication [3]. LEF-3 and other
CC   proteins have been shown to bind to closely linked sites on

DE   Baculoviridae p74 conserved region
CC   Baculoviruses are distinct from other virus families in that
CC   there are two viral phenotypes: budded virus (BV) and

DE   BAF1 / ABF1 chromatin reorganising factor
CC   ABF1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein involved in

CC   proposed that it mediates its effects on  transcription and gene
CC   expression by modifying local chromatin architecture [1]. These
CC   functions require a conserved stretch of 20 amino acids in the 
CC   C-terminal region of ABF1 (amino acids 639 to 662 S. cerevisiae

CC   Biotin synthase (BioB), EC:2.8.1.6 , catalyses the last step of

CC   as a homodimer [1].  Thiamin synthesis if a complex process
CC   involving at least six gene products (ThiFSGH, ThiI and ThiJ).
CC   Two of the proteins required for the biosynthesis of the
CC   thiazole moiety of thiamine (vitamin B(1)) are ThiG and ThiH
CC   (this family) and form a heterodimer[2].  Both of these

CC   both function as dimers [1,2]. This domain therefore may be
CC   involved in co-factor binding or dimerisation (Finn, RD personal
CC   observation).

DE   Inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting Bax1
CC   Programmed cell-death involves a set of Bcl-2 family proteins,

CC   The C termini of the mammalian BI-1 proteins are comprised of

DE   Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, BAD
CC   BAD is a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic member
CC   of the Bcl-2 protein family that is regulated by phosphorylation
CC   in response to survival factors [1]. Binding of BAD to
CC   mitochondria is thought to be exclusively mediated by its BH3
CC   domain. Membrane localisation of BAD mediates membrane
CC   translocation of Bcl-XL. The C-terminal part of BAD is
CC   sufficient for membrane binding. There are two segments with
CC   differing lipid-binding preferences, LBD1 and LBD2, that are
CC   responsible for this binding: (i) LBD1 located in the proximity
CC   of the BH3 domain (amino acids 122-131) and (ii) LBD2, the
CC   putative C-terminal alpha-helix-5 [2]. Phosphorylation-regulated
CC   14-3-3 protein binding may expose the cholesterol-preferring

DE   Bestrophin, RFP-TM, chloride channel
CC   Bestrophin is a 68-kDa basolateral plasma membrane protein
CC   expressed in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). It is
CC   encoded by the VMD2 gene, which is mutated in Best macular
CC   dystrophy, a disease characterised by a depressed light peak in
CC   the electrooculogram [1].  VMD2 encodes a 585-amino acid protein
CC   with an approximate mass of 68 kDa which has been designated
CC   bestrophin. Bestrophin shares homology with the Caenorhabditis
CC   elegans RFP gene family, named for the presence of a conserved
CC   arginine (R), phenylalanine (F), proline (P), amino acid
CC   sequence motif.  Bestrophin is a plasma membrane protein,
CC   localised to the basolateral surface of RPE cells consistent
CC   with a role for bestrophin in the generation or regulation of
CC   the EOG light peak. Bestrophin and other RFP family members
CC   represent a new class of chloride channels, indicating a direct
CC   role for bestrophin in generating the light peak [1]. The VMD2
CC   gene underlying Best disease was shown to represent the first
CC   human member of the RFP-TM protein family. More than 97% of the
CC   disease-causing mutations are located in the N-terminal RFP-TM
CC   domain implying important functional properties [2]. The
CC   bestrophins are four-pass transmembrane chloride-channel
CC   proteins [3], and the RFP-TM or bestrophin domain extends from
CC   the N-terminus through approximately 350 amino acids and
CC   contains all of the TM domains as well as nearly all reported
CC   disease causing mutations [4]. Interestingly, the RFP motif is
CC   not conserved evolutionarily back beyond Metazoa, neither is it
CC   in plant members.

DE   D domain of beta-TrCP
CC   This domain is found in eukaryotes, and is approximately 40
CC   amino acids in length. It is found associated with Pfam:PF00646,
CC   Pfam:PF00400. The protein that contains this domain functions as
CC   a ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitination is required to direct
CC   proteins towards the proteasome for degradation. This protein is
CC   part of the WD40 class of F box proteins. The D domain of these
CC   F box proteins is involved in mediating the dimerisation of the
CC   protein.  Dimerisation is necessary to polyubiquitinate
CC   substrates so this D domain is vital in directing substrates
CC   towards the proteasome for degradation.

DE   Beta-trefoil
CC   Members of this family of DNA binding domains adopt a

DE   Beta-galactosidase, domain 2
CC   This is the second domain of the five-domain beta-galactosidase
CC   enzyme that altogether catalyses the hydrolysis of beta(1-3) and
CC   beta(1-4) galactosyl bonds in oligosaccharides as well as the
CC   inverse reaction of enzymatic condensation and
CC   trans-glycosylation. This domain is made up of 16 antiparallel
CC   beta-strands and an alpha-helix at its C terminus. The fold of
CC   this domain appears to be unique.  In addition, the last seven
CC   strands of the domain form a subdomain with an
CC   immunoglobulin-like (I-type Ig) fold in which the first strand
CC   is divided between the two beta-sheets. In penicillin spp this
CC   strand is interrupted by a 12-residue insertion which forms an
CC   additional edge-strand to the second beta-sheet of the
CC   sub-domain. The remainder of the second domain forms a series of
CC   beta-hairpins at its N terminus, four strands of which are
CC   contiguous with part of the Ig-like sub-domain, forming in total
CC   a seven-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. This domain is
CC   associated with family Glyco_hydro_35, Pfam:PF01301, which is
CC   N-terminal to it, but itself has no metazoan members.

DE   Pathogenesis-related protein Bet v I family
CC   This family is named after Bet v 1, the major birch pollen
CC   allergen. This protein belongs to family 10 of plant
CC   pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-10), cytoplasmic proteins of
CC   15-17 kd that are wide-spread among dicotyledonous plants [1].
CC   In recent years, a number of diverse plant proteins with low
CC   sequence similarity to Bet v 1 was identified. A classification
CC   by sequence similarity yielded several subfamilies related to
CC   PR-10 [2]: - Pathogenesis-related proteins PR-10: These proteins
CC   were identified as major tree pollen allergens in birch and
CC   related species (hazel, alder), as plant food allergens
CC   expressed in high levels in fruits, vegetables and seeds (apple,
CC   celery, hazelnut), and as pathogenesis-related proteins whose
CC   expression is induced by pathogen infection, wounding, or
CC   abiotic stress. Hyp-1 (Swiss:Q8H1L1), an enzyme involved in the
CC   synthesis of the bioactive naphthodianthrone hypericin in St.
CC   John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) also belongs to this family.
CC   Most of these proteins were found in dicotyledonous plants. In
CC   addition, related sequences were identified in monocots and
CC   conifers. - Cytokinin-specific binding proteins: These legume
CC   proteins bind cytokinin plant hormones [3]. - (S)-Norcoclaurine
CC   synthases are enzymes catalysing the condensation of dopamine
CC   and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to (S)-norcoclaurine, the first
CC   committed step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline
CC   alkaloids such as morphine [4]. -Major latex proteins and
CC   ripening-related proteins are proteins of unknown biological
CC   function that were first discovered in the latex of opium poppy
CC   (Papaver somniferum) and later found to be upregulated during
CC   ripening of fruits such as strawberry and cucumber [5]. The
CC   occurrence of Bet v 1-related proteins is confined to seed
CC   plants with the exception of a cytokinin-binding protein from
CC   the moss Physcomitrella patens (Swiss:Q9AXI3).

DE   Brain expressed X-linked like family 
CC   This is a family of transcription elongation factors which
CC   includes those referred to as Bex proteins as well as those
CC   named TCEAL7. Bex1 was shown to be a novel link between
CC   neurotrophin signalling, the cell cycle, and neuronal
CC   differentiation, suggesting it might function by coordinating
CC   internal cellular states with the ability of cells to respond to
CC   external signals [2]. TCEAL7 has been shown negatively to
CC   regulate the NF-kappaB pathway, hence being important in ovarian
CC   cancer as it one of the genes frequently downregulated in this
CC   cancer. A closely related protein, TFIIS/TCEA, found in
CC   Pfam:PF07500 is involved in transcription elongation and
CC   transcript fidelity. TFIIS/TCEA promotes 3' endoribonuclease
CC   activity of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and allows pol II to
CC   bypass transcript pause or 'arrest' during elongation process.
CC   It is thus possible that BEX is also acting in this way [2].

DE   Bacterial OB fold (BOF) protein
CC   Proteins in this family form an OB-fold.  Analysis of the

DE   BRCA1 C Terminus (BRCT) domain
CC   The BRCT domain is found predominantly in proteins involved in
CC   cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage.  The
CC   BRCT domain of XRCC1 forms a homodimer in the crystal structure.
CC   This suggests that pairs of BRCT domains associate as homo- or

CC   mode [3]. This conserved tandem BRCT architecture facilitates
CC   formation of the canonical BRCT phospho-peptide interaction
CC   cleft at a groove between the BRCT domains. Disease associated

DE   Bystin
CC   Trophinin and tastin form a cell adhesion molecule complex that
CC   potentially mediates an initial attachment of the blastocyst to
CC   uterine epithelial cells at the time of implantation. Trophinin
CC   and tastin bind to an intermediary cytoplasmic protein called

CC   invasion because bystin is found with trophinin and tastin in
CC   the cells at human implantation sites and also in the

CC   ENP1. ENP1 is an essential protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
CC   and is localised in the nucleus [2]. It is thought that ENP1
CC   plays a direct role in the early steps of rRNA processing as
CC   enp1 defective yeast cannot synthesise 20S pre-rRNA and hence

DE   CagZ
CC   CagZ is a 23 kDa protein consisting of a single compact L-shaped
CC   domain, composed of seven alpha-helices that run antiparallel to

DE   Calcium binding
CC   CcbP is a Ca(2+) binding protein which, in Anabaena, is thought
CC   to bind Ca(2+) by protein surface charge. When bound to Ca(2+),
CC   the protein becomes more compact and the level of free calcium
CC   decreases. The free Ca(2+) concentration which is regulated by
CC   CcbP is critical for the differentiation process [1]. Calcium
CC   signalling is widespread in bacterial species, and prokaryotic
CC   cells like eukaryotes are equipped with all the elements to
CC   maintain Ca2+ homeostasis [2].

DE   Calcium binding and coiled-coil domain (CALCOCO1) like
CC   Proteins found in this family are similar to the coiled-coil
CC   transcriptional coactivator protein coexpressed by Mus musculus
CC   (CoCoA/CALCOCO1, Swiss:Q8CGU1). This protein binds to a highly
CC   conserved N-terminal domain of p160 coactivators, such as GRIP1
CC   (Swiss:Q61026), and thus enhances transcriptional activation by
CC   a number of nuclear receptors. CALCOCO1 has a central
CC   coiled-coil region with three leucine zipper motifs, which is
CC   required for its interaction with GRIP1 and may regulate the
CC   autonomous transcriptional activation activity of the C-terminal
CC   region [1].

DE   D1 dopamine receptor-interacting protein (calcyon)
CC   This family consists of several  D1 dopamine
CC   receptor-interacting (calcyon) proteins.  D1/D5 dopamine
CC   receptors in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex
CC   modulate motor, reward, and cognitive behaviour. D1-like
CC   dopamine receptors likely modulate neocortical and hippocampal
CC   neuronal excitability and synaptic function via Ca(2+) as well
CC   as cAMP-dependent signaling [1]. Defective calcyon proteins have

CC   This family contains plant proteins related to caleosin.
CC   Caleosins contain calcium-binding domains and have an
CC   oleosin-like association with lipid  bodies. Caleosins are
CC   present at relatively low levels and are mainly bound to
CC   microsomal membrane fractions at the early stages of seed
CC   development. As the seeds mature, overall levels of caleosins

DE   Calcineurin-binding protein (Calsarcin)
CC   This family consists of several mammalian calcineurin-binding
CC   proteins. The calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein
CC   phosphatase calcineurin has been implicated in the transduction
CC   of signals that control the hypertrophy of cardiac muscle and
CC   slow fibre gene expression in skeletal muscle. Calsarcin-1 and
CC   calsarcin-2 are expressed in developing cardiac and skeletal
CC   muscle during embryogenesis, but calsarcin-1 is expressed
CC   specifically in adult cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscle,
CC   whereas calsarcin-2 is restricted to fast skeletal muscle.
CC   Calsarcins represent a novel family of sarcomeric proteins that
CC   link calcineurin with the contractile apparatus, thereby
CC   potentially coupling muscle activity to calcineurin activation
CC   [1]. Calsarcin-3, is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle
CC   and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibres. Like calsarcin-1
CC   and calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3 interacts with calcineurin, and the

DE   Calmodulin binding domain
CC   Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels) are
CC   independent of voltage and gated solely by intracellular Ca2+.
CC   These membrane channels are heteromeric complexes that comprise
CC   pore-forming alpha-subunits and the Ca2+-binding protein
CC   calmodulin (CaM) [1]. CaM binds to the SK channel through this
CC   the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD), which is located in an
CC   intracellular region of the alpha-subunit immediately
CC   carboxy-terminal to the pore. Channel opening is triggered when
CC   Ca2+ binds the EF hands in the N-lobe of CaM. The structure of
CC   this domain complexed with CaM is known [1]. This domain forms
CC   an elongated dimer with a CaM molecule bound at each end; each
CC   CaM wraps around three alpha-helices, two from one CaMBD subunit
CC   and one from the other.

DE   Calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II Association

CC   a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain (Pfam:PF00069) at their
CC   N-terminus [1].  The function of the CaMKII association domain
CC   is the assembly of the single proteins into large (8 to 14

DE   Microtubule-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated
CC   This is the C-terminal domain of a family of eumetazoan proteins
CC   collectively defined as calmodulin-regulated
CC   spectrin-associated, or CAMSAP, proteins. CAMSAP proteins carry
CC   an N-terminal region that includes the CH domain, a central
CC   region including a predicted coiled-coil and this C-terminal, or
CC   CKK, domain - defined as being present in CAMSAP, KIAA1078 and
CC   KIAA1543, The C-terminal domain is the part of the CAMSAP
CC   proteins that binds to microtubules. The domain appears to act
CC   by producing inhibition of neurite extension, probably by
CC   blocking microtubule function. CKK represents a domain that has
CC   evolved with the metazoa. The structure of a murine hypothetical
CC   protein from RIKEN cDNA has shown the domain to adopt a mainly
CC   beta barrel structure with an associated alpha-helical hairpin.

DE   Calmodulin-binding domain C0 of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit
CC   This is a very short highly conserved domain that is C-terminal

CC   It has been shown to bind Calmodulin-Calcium with high affinity.
CC   The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major
CC   source of calcium flux into neurons in the brain and plays a
CC   critical role in learning, memory, neural development, and
CC   synaptic plasticity. Calmodulin (CaM) regulates NMDARs by
CC   binding tightly to the C0 and C1 regions of their NR1 subunit.

CC   Swiss:Q8W235, Swiss:Q84ZT8 and Swiss:Q8H6X1), and are  thought
CC   to constitute the calmodulin-binding domains [1,2]. Binding of
CC   the proteins to calmodulin depends on the presence of calcium

CC   stolonisation or tuberization [2].
AC   PF05792.7
DE   Candida agglutinin-like (ALS)
CC   This family consists of several agglutinin-like proteins from
CC   different Candida species. ALS genes of Candida albicans encode
CC   a family of cell-surface glycoproteins with a three-domain
CC   structure. Each Als protein has a relatively conserved
CC   N-terminal domain, a central domain consisting of a tandemly
CC   repeated motif of variable number, and a serine-threonine-rich
CC   C-terminal domain that is relatively variable across the family.
CC   The ALS family exhibits several types of variability that
CC   indicate the importance of considering strain and allelic
CC   differences when studying ALS genes and their encoded proteins
CC   [1]. Fungal adhesins, which include sexual agglutinins,
CC   virulence factors, and flocculins, are surface proteins that
CC   mediate cell-cell and cell-environment interactions. It is
CC   possible that both the serine/threonine-rich domain and the
CC   cysteine residues in the C-terminal and DIPSY Pfam:PF11763
CC   participate in anchoring the terminal domains inside the wall,
CC   so that only the inner part of Map4p, including the repeat
CC   region, is sticking out as a fold-back loop then able to act in
CC   adhesing [3].

DE   Cysteine-rich secretory protein family
CC   This is a large family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins,
CC   antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) that are
CC   found in a wide range of organisms, including prokaryotes [2]
CC   and non-vertebrate eukaryotes [3], The nine subfamilies of the
CC   mammalian CAP 'super'family include: the human glioma
CC   pathogenesis-related 1 (GLIPR1), Golgi associated pathogenesis
CC   related-1 (GAPR1) proteins, peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15),
CC   peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16), cysteine-rich secretory proteins
CC   (CRISPs), CRISP LCCL domain containing 1 (CRISPLD1), CRISP LCCL
CC   domain containing 2 (CRISPLD2), mannose receptor like and the
CC   R3H domain containing like proteins.	Members are most often
CC   secreted and have an extracellular endocrine or paracrine
CC   function and are involved in processes including the regulation
CC   of extracellular matrix and branching morphogenesis, potentially
CC   as either proteases or protease inhibitors; in ion channel
CC   regulation in fertility; as tumour suppressor or pro-oncogenic
CC   genes in tissues including the prostate; and in cell-cell
CC   adhesion during fertilisation. The overall protein structural
CC   conservation within the CAP 'super'family results in
CC   fundamentally similar functions for the CAP domain in all
CC   members, yet the diversity outside of this core region
CC   dramatically alters the target specificity and, thus, the
CC   biological consequences [4]. The Ca++-chelating function [3]
CC   would fit with the various signalling processes (e.g. the CRISP
CC   proteins) that members of this family are involved in, and also
CC   the sequence and structural evidence of a conserved pocket
CC   containing two histidines and a glutamate. It also may explain
CC   how Swiss:Q91055 blocks the Ca++ transporting ryanodine
CC   receptors.

DE   CAP160 repeat
CC   This region featured in this family is repeated in spinach cold
CC   acclimation protein CAP160 (Swiss:O50054) CAP160 is induced
CC   during periods of drought stress; its precise function is
CC   unknown but it has been implicated in the stabilisation of
CC   membranes, cytoskeletal elements, and ribosomes. By acting as a
CC   compatible solute, it may reduce the toxic effects of cellular
CC   solutes that accumulate at high concentration during
CC   dehydration; it may also function as an enzyme that produces
CC   such a solute [1]. Other members of this family are also induced
CC   by water stress, abscisic acid, and/or low temperature, such as

CC   This family is the C terminal region of caprin-1. Caprin-1 is a
CC   protein involved in regulating cellular proliferation. In
CC   mutated phenotypes, the G1 phase of the cell cycle is greatly
CC   lengthened, impairing normal proliferation. The C terminal
CC   region of caprin-1 contains RGG motifs which are characteristic

DE   Large eukaryotic DNA virus major capsid protein
CC   This family includes the major capsid protein of iridoviruses,

CC   viruses with no RNA stage. This is the most abundant structural
CC   protein and can account for up to 45% of virion protein [1].	In
CC   Chlorella virus PBCV-1 the major capsid protein is a
CC   glycoprotein [2]. The four families of large eukaryotic DNA
CC   viruses, Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, Iridoviridae, and
CC   Phycodnaviridae, are referred to collectively as
CC   nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses or NCLDV. The virions of

CC   major capsid proteins of iridoviruses and phycodnaviruses, both
CC   of which have icosahedral capsids surrounding an inner lipid
CC   membrane, showed a high level of sequence conservation. A more
CC   limited, but statistically significant sequence similarity was
CC   observed between these proteins and the major capsid protein
CC   (p72) of ASFV, which also has an icosahedral capsid. It was

DE   CRISPR associated protein Cas6
CC   This group of families is one of several protein families that
CC   are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves
CC   a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
CC   repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and
CC   archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably
CC   regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called
CC   spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [1]. It has been shown
CC   that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the
CC   host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins
CC   from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response.
CC   After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins
CC   termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and
CC   retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived
CC   sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR
CC   RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to
CC   interfere with virus proliferation [2]. Cas5 contains an
CC   endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of
CC   resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [3].

DE   CAS/CSE protein, C-terminus
CC   Mammalian cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS) proteins are
CC   homologous to the yeast chromosome-segregation protein, CSE1
CC   [1]. This family aligns the C-terminal halves (approximately).
CC   CAS is involved in both cellular apoptosis and proliferation
CC   [2,3]. Apoptosis is inhibited in CAS-depleted cells, while the
CC   expression of CAS correlates to the degree of cellular
CC   proliferation.  Like CSE1, it is essential for the mitotic
CC   checkpoint in the cell cycle (CAS depletion blocks the cell in
CC   the G2 phase), and has been shown to be associated with the
CC   microtubule network and the mitotic spindle [3], as is the
CC   protein MEK, which is thought to regulate the intracellular
CC   localisation (predominantly nuclear vs. predominantly cytosolic)
CC   of CAS. In the nucleus, CAS acts as a nuclear transport factor
CC   in the importin pathway [4]. The importin pathway mediates the
CC   nuclear transport of several proteins that are necessary for
CC   mitosis and further progression. CAS is therefore thought to
CC   affect the cell cycle through its effect on the nuclear
CC   transport of these proteins [4]. Since apoptosis also requires
CC   the nuclear import of several proteins (such as P53 and
CC   transcription factors), it has been suggested that CAS also
CC   enables apoptosis by facilitating the nuclear import of at least
CC   a subset of these essential proteins [5].

DE   Cobalamin synthesis G C-terminus
CC   Members of this family are involved in cobalamin synthesis.  The
CC   gene encoded by Swiss:P72862 has been designated cbiH but in
CC   fact represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other

CC   catalyse adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL
CC   (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG
CC   catalyses a reaction step adjacent to CbiH. In the anaerobic
CC   pathway such a step could be the formation of a gamma lactone,
CC   which is thought to help to mediate the anaerobic ring
CC   contraction process [1]. Within the cobalamin synthesis pathway
CC   CbiG catalyses the both the opening of the lactone ring and the
CC   extrusion of the two-carbon fragment of cobalt-precorrin-5A from

DE   Di-haem cytochrome c peroxidase
CC   This is a family of distinct cytochrome c peroxidases (CCPs)
CC   that contain two haem groups. Similar to other cytochrome c

DE   LEM3 (ligand-effect modulator 3) family / CDC50 family
CC   Members of this family have been predicted to contain
CC   transmembrane helices. The family member LEM3 (Swiss:P42838) is
CC   a ligand-effect modulator, mutation of which increases
CC   glucocorticoid receptor activity in response to dexamethasone
CC   and also confers increased activity on other intracellular
CC   receptors including the progesterone, oestrogen and
CC   mineralocorticoid receptors. LEM3 is thought to affect a
CC   downstream step in the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. Factors
CC   that modulate ligand responsiveness are likely to contribute to
CC   the context-specific actions of the glucocorticoid receptor in
CC   mammalian cells [1]. The products of genes YNR048w
CC   (Swiss:P53740), YNL323w (Swiss:P42838) and YCR094w
CC   (Swiss:P25656) (CDC50) show redundancy of function and are
CC   involved in regulation of transcription via CDC39 [2]. CDC39
CC   (also known as NOT1) is normally a negative regulator of
CC   transcription either by affecting the general RNA polymerase II
CC   machinery or by altering chromatin structure [4]. One function
CC   of CDC39 is to block activation of the mating response pathway
CC   in the absence of pheromone, and mutation causes arrest in G1 by
CC   activation of the pathway [3]. It may be that the cold-sensitive
CC   arrest in G1 noticed in CDC50 mutants [2] may be due to
CC   inactivation of CDC39.  The effects of LEM3 on glucocorticoid
CC   receptor activity may also be due to effects on transcription
CC   via CDC39.

DE   Complement Clr-like EGF-like
CC   cEGF, or complement Clr-like EGF, domains have six conserved
CC   cysteine residues disulfide-bonded into the characteristic
CC   pattern 'ababcc'. They are found in blood coagulation proteins
CC   such as fibrillin, Clr and Cls, thrombomodulin, and the LDL
CC   receptor. The core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small
CC   beta-hairpins packed against each other. Two major structural
CC   variants have been identified based on the structural context of
CC   the C-terminal cysteine residue of disulfide 'c' in the
CC   C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In cEGFs the C-terminal
CC   thiol resides on the C-terminal beta-sheet, resulting in long
CC   loop-lengths between the cysteine residues of disulfide 'c',
CC   typically C[10+]XC. These longer loop-lengths may have arisen by
CC   selective cysteine loss from a four-disulfide EGF template such
CC   as laminin or integrin.  Tandem cEGF domains have five linking
CC   residues between terminal cysteines of adjacent domains. cEGF
CC   domains may or may not bind calcium in the linker region. cEGF
CC   domains with the consensus motif CXN4X[F,Y]XCXC are hydroxylated

CC   bacteria and fungi, and even some animals. The genes that
CC   synthesise cellulose in higher plants differ greatly from the
CC   well-characterised genes found in Acetobacter and Agrobacterium
CC   sp. More correctly designated as 'cellulose synthase catalytic
CC   subunits', plant cellulose synthase (CesA) proteins are integral
CC   membrane proteins, approximately 1,000 amino acids in length.

CC   however this has not been proven experimentally [2].
AC   PF10511.3
DE   Trappin protein transglutaminase binding domain
CC   Trappin-2, itself a protease inhibitor, has this unique
CC   N-terminal domain that enables it to become cross-linked to
CC   extracellular matrix proteins by transglutaminase [1]. This
CC   domain contains several repeated motifs with the the consensus
CC   sequence Gly-Gln-Asp-Pro-Val-Lys, and these together can anchor
CC   the whole molecule to extracellular matrix proteins, such as
CC   laminin, fibronectin, beta-crystallin, collagen IV, fibrinogen,
CC   and elastin, by transglutaminase-catalysed cross-links. The
CC   whole domain is rich in glutamine and lysine, thus allowing and
CC   transglutaminase(s) to catalyse the formation of an
CC   intermolecular epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bond
CC   [2]. Cementoin is associated with the WAP family, Pfam:PF00095,

DE   Centromere protein B dimerisation domain
CC   The centromere protein B (CENP-B) dimerisation domain is
CC   composed of two alpha-helices, which are folded into an
CC   antiparallel configuration. Dimerisation of CENP-B is mediated
CC   by this domain, in which monomers dimerise to form a
CC   symmetrical, antiparallel, four-helix bundle structure with a
CC   large hydrophobic patch in which 23 residues of one monomer form
CC   van der Waals contacts with the other monomer. This CENP-B dimer
CC   configuration may be suitable for capturing two distant CENP-B
CC   boxes during centromeric heterochromatin formation [1].
AC   PF04218.7
DE   CENP-B N-terminal DNA-binding domain
CC   Centromere Protein B (CENP-B) is a DNA-binding protein localised
CC   to the centromere. Within the N-terminal 125 residues, there is
CC   a DNA-binding region, which binds to a corresponding 17bp CENP-B
CC   box sequence. CENP-B dimers either bind two separate DNA
CC   molecules or alternatively, they may bind two CENP-B boxes on
CC   one DNA molecule, with the intervening stretch of DNA forming a
CC   loop structure. The CENP-B DNA-binding domain consists of two
CC   repeating domains, RP1 and RP2. This family corresponds to RP1

CC   Cenp-F, a centromeric kinetochore, microtubule-binding protein
CC   consisting of two 1,600-amino acid-long coils, is essential for
CC   the full functioning of the mitotic checkpoint pathway [1,2].
CC   There are several leucine-rich repeats along the sequence of

CC   Mitosin or centromere-associated protein-F (Cenp-F) is found
CC   bound across the centromere as one of the proteins of the outer
CC   layer of the kinetochore [1]. Most of the kinetochore/centromere
CC   functions appear to depend upon binding of the C-terminal par to
CC   f the molecule, whereas the N-terminal part, here, may be a
CC   cytoplasmic player in controlling the function of microtubules
CC   and dynein [2].
AC   PF05837.6
DE   Centromere protein H (CENP-H)
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic centromere protein H
CC   (CENP-H) sequences. Macromolecular centromere-kinetochore
CC   complex plays a critical role in sister chromatid separation,
CC   but its complete protein composition as well as its precise
CC   dynamic function during mitosis has not yet been clearly
CC   determined. CENP-H contains a coiled-coil structure and a
CC   nuclear localisation signal. CENP-H is specifically and
CC   constitutively localised in kinetochores throughout the cell
CC   cycle. CENP-H may play a role in kinetochore organisation and
CC   function throughout the cell cycle [1]. This the C-terminus of
CC   the region, which is conserved from fungi to humans.

DE   Centromere-associated protein K
CC   CENP-K is one of seven new CENP-A-nucleosome distal (CAD)
CC   centromere components (the others being CENP-L, CENP-O, CENP-P,
CC   CENP-Q, CENP-R and CENP-S) that are identified as assembling on
CC   the CENP-A nucleosome associated complex, NAC. The CENP-A NAC is
CC   essential, as disruption of the complex causes errors of
CC   chromosome alignment and segregation that preclude cell survival
CC   despite continued centromere-derived mitotic checkpoint
CC   signalling. CENP-K is centromere-associated through its
CC   interaction with one or more components of the CENP-A NAC.
AC   PF11111.2
DE   Centromere protein M (CENP-M)
CC   The prime candidate for specifying centromere identity is the
CC   array of nucleosomes assembles with CENP-A [1]. CENP-A recruits
CC   a nucleosome associated complex (NAC) comprised of CENP-M along
CC   with two other proteins [1]. Assembly of the CENP-A NAC at
CC   centromeres is partly dependant on CENP-M. The CENP-A NAC is
CC   essential, as disruption of the complex causes errors of
CC   chromosome alignment and segregation that preclude cell survival
CC   [1].
AC   PF09496.4
DE   Cenp-O kinetochore centromere component
CC   This eukaryotic protein is a component of the inner kinetochore
CC   subcomplex of the centromere.  It has been shown to be involved
CC   in chromosome segregation via regulation of the spindle in both
CC   yeast and human [1][2].
AC   PF09415.4
DE   CENP-S associating Centromere protein X
CC   The centromere, essential for faithful chromosome segregation
CC   during mitosis, has a network of constitutive
CC   centromere-associated (CCAN) proteins associating with it during
CC   mitosis. So far in vertebrates at least 15 centromere proteins
CC   have been identified, which are divided into several subclasses
CC   based on functional and biochemical analyses. These provide a
CC   platform for the formation of a functional kinetochore during
CC   mitosis. CENP-S is one that does not associate with the
CC   CENP-H-containing complex but rather interacts with CENP-X to
CC   form a stable assembly of outer kinetochore proteins that
CC   functions downstream of other components of the CCAN. This
CC   complex may directly allow efficient and stable formation of the
CC   outer kinetochore on the CCAN platform.

AC   PF11439.2
DE   Type III secretion system filament chaperone CesA
CC   This family represents a chaperone protein for the type III
CC   secretion system - TTSS - translocon protein EspA, to prevent
CC   the latter's self-polymerisation. The TTSS is a highly
CC   specialised bacterial protein secretory pathway, similar in many
CC   ways to the flagellar system, that is essential for the
CC   pathogenesis of many Gram-negative bacteria. The twenty or so
CC   proteins making up the TTSS apparatus, referred to as the needle
CC   complex, allow the injection of virulence proteins (known as
CC   effectors) directly into the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic host
CC   cells they infect; however, the injection process itself is
CC   mediated by a subset of extracellular proteins that are secreted
CC   by the needle complex to the bacterial surface and assembled
CC   into the type III translocon - EspA. EspB and EspD. EspA
CC   polymerises into an extracellular filament, and, as with other
CC   fibrous proteins, is apt to undergo massive polymerisation when
CC   overexpressed. CesA is the secretion chaperone protein that
CC   binds to EspA. CesA is dimeric and helical, and it traps EspA in
CC   a monomeric state and inhibits its polymerisation.
AC   PF05932.7
DE   Tir chaperone protein (CesT)
CC   This family consists of a number of bacterial sequences which
CC   are highly similar to the Tir chaperone protein in E. Coli. In
CC   many Gram-negative bacteria, a key indicator of pathogenic
CC   potential is the possession of a specialised type III secretion
CC   system, which is utilised to deliver virulence effector proteins
CC   directly into the host cell cytosol. Many of the proteins
CC   secreted from such systems require small cytosolic chaperones to
CC   maintain the secreted substrates in a secretion-competent state.
CC   CesT serves a chaperone function for the enteropathogenic
CC   Escherichia coli (EPEC) translocated intimin receptor (Tir)
CC   protein, which confers upon EPEC the ability to alter host cell
CC   morphology following intimate bacterial attachment [1].

CC   virulence effector proteins from  bacterial pathogens directly
CC   into eukaryotic cells. The chaperones may prevent aggregation
CC   and degradation of their substrates, may target the effector to

CC   beta-hexosaminidases EC:3.2.1.52. It is composed of a beta
CC   sandwich structure that is similar in structure to the cellulose
CC   binding domain of cellulase from Cellulomonas fimi [1].  This

AC   PF06747.7
DE   CHCH domain
CC   we have identified a conserved motif in the LOC118487 protein
CC   that we have called the CHCH motif. Alignment of this protein
CC   with related members showed the presence of three subgroups of
CC   proteins, which are called the S (Small), N (N-terminal
CC   extended) and C (C-terminal extended) subgroups. All three
CC   sub-groups of proteins have in common that they contain a
CC   predicted conserved [coiled coil 1]-[helix 1]-[coiled coil
CC   2]-[helix 2] domain (CHCH domain). Within each helix of the CHCH
CC   domain, there are two cysteines present in a C-X9-C motif. The
CC   N-group contains an additional double helix domain, and each
CC   helix contains the C-X9-C motif. This family contains a number
CC   of characterised proteins: Cox19 protein - a nuclear gene of
CC   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, codes for an 11-kDa protein (Cox19p)
CC   required for expression of cytochrome oxidase. Because cox19
CC   mutants are able to synthesise the mitochondrial and nuclear
CC   gene products of cytochrome oxidase, Cox19p probably functions
CC   post-translationally during assembly of the enzyme. Cox19p is
CC   present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it exists as a
CC   soluble intermembrane protein. This dual location is similar to
CC   what was previously reported for Cox17p, a low molecular weight
CC   copper protein thought to be required for maturation of the CuA
CC   centre of subunit 2 of cytochrome oxidase. Cox19p have four
CC   conserved potential metal ligands, these are three cysteines and
CC   one histidine. Mrp10 - belongs to the class of yeast
CC   mitochondrial ribosomal proteins that are essential for
CC   translation [2]. Eukaryotic NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19
CC   kDa (NDUFA8) subunit [3]. The CHCH domain was previously called
CC   DUF657 [4].
AC   PF04420.8
DE   CHD5-like protein
CC   Members of this family are probably coiled-coil proteins that
CC   are similar to the CHD5 (Congenital heart disease 5) protein. In

CC   thought to play a homeostatic role [2].

DE   CheB methylesterase
AC   PF04509.6
DE   CheC-like family
CC   The restoration of pre-stimulus levels of the chemotactic
CC   response regulator, CheY-P, is important for allowing bacteria
CC   to respond to new environmental stimuli.  The members of this
CC   family, CheC, CheX, CheA and FliY are CheY-P phosphatase [1,2].
CC   CheC appears to be primarily involved in restoring normal CheY-P
CC   levels, whereas FliY seems to act on CheY-P constitutively. CheD
CC   enhances the activity of CheC 5-fold, which is normally
CC   relatively low [1,2].  In some cases, the region represented by
CC   this entry is present as multiple copies.
AC   PF03975.7
DE   CheD chemotactic sensory transduction
CC   This chemotaxis protein stimulates methylation of MCP proteins
CC   [1]. The chemotaxis machinery of Bacillus subtilis is similar to
CC   that of the well characterised system of Escherichia coli.
CC   However, B. subtilis contains several chemotaxis genes not found
CC   in the E. coli genome, such as CheC and CheD, indicating that
CC   the B. subtilis chemotactic system is more complex. CheD plays
CC   an important role in chemotactic sensory transduction for many
CC   organisms. CheD deamidates other B. subtilis chemoreceptors
CC   including McpB and McpC. Deamidation by CheD is required for B.
CC   subtilis chemoreceptors to effectively transduce signals to the
CC   CheA kinase [2]. The structure of a complex between the
CC   signal-terminating phosphatase, CheC, and the receptor-modifying
CC   deamidase, CheD, reveals how CheC mimics receptor substrates to
CC   inhibit CheD and how CheD stimulates CheC phosphatase activity.
CC   CheD resembles other cysteine deamidases from bacterial
CC   pathogens that inactivate host Rho-GTPases. Phospho-CheY, the
CC   intracellular signal and CheC target, stabilises the CheC-CheD
CC   complex and reduces availability of CheD [3]. A model is
CC   proposed whereby CheC acts as a CheY-P-induced regulator of
CC   CheD; CheY-P would cause CheC to sequester CheD from the
CC   chemoreceptors, inducing adaptation of the chemotaxis system
CC   [4].
AC   PF04283.6
DE   Chemotaxis signal transduction system protein F from archaea
CC   This is a family of proteins that are archaea-specific
CC   components of the bacterial-like chemotaxis signal transduction
CC   system of archaea. In H. salinarum, the CheF proteins interact
CC   with the chemotaxis proteins CheY, CheD and CheC2 as well as the
CC   flagella-accessory proteins FlaCE and FlaD, and are essential
CC   for any tactic response. CheF probably functions at the
CC   interface between the bacterial-like chemotaxis signal
CC   transduction system and the archaeal flagellar apparatus.
AC   PF01739.12
DE   CheR methyltransferase, SAM binding domain
CC   CheR proteins are part of the chemotaxis signaling mechanism in
CC   bacteria. CheR methylates the chemotaxis receptor at specific
CC   glutamate residues. CheR is an S-adenosylmethionine- dependent
CC   methyltransferase - the C-terminal domain (this one) binds SAM.
AC   PF03705.9
DE   CheR methyltransferase, all-alpha domain

CC   methyltransferase.
AC   PF01584.13
DE   CheW-like domain
CC   CheW proteins are part of the chemotaxis signaling mechanism in
CC   bacteria.	       CheW interacts with the methyl accepting
CC   chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and relays signals to CheY, which
CC   affects flageller rotation. This family includes CheW and other
CC   related proteins that are involved in chemotaxis.  The CheW-like
CC   regulatory domain in CheA [1] binds to CheW, suggesting that
CC   these domains can interact with each other.
AC   PF09078.5
DE   CheY binding
CC   Members of this family adopt a secondary structure consisting of
CC   an open-face beta/alpha sandwich, with four antiparallel
CC   beta-strands and two alpha-helices. They bind to a corresponding
CC   domain on CheY, with subsequent phosphorylation of the CheY
CC   Asp57 residue, and activation of CheY, which then affects
CC   flagellar rotation [1].
AC   PF04344.7
DE   Chemotaxis phosphatase, CheZ
CC   This family represents the bacterial chemotaxis phosphatase,
CC   CheZ. This protein forms a dimer characterised by a long
CC   four-helix bundle, composed of two helices from each monomer.
CC   CheZ dephosphorylates CheY in a reaction that is essential to
CC   maintain a continuous chemotactic response to environmental
CC   changes. It is thought that CheZ's conserved residue Gln 147
CC   orientates a water molecule for nucleophilic attack at the CheY
CC   active site.

AC   PF08329.4
DE   Chitinase A, N-terminal domain
CC   This domain is found in a number of bacterial chitinases and

CC   module domain-like fold, comprising only beta strands. Its
CC   function is not known, but it may be involved in interaction
CC   with the enzyme substrate, chitin [1,2]. It is separated by a
CC   hinge region from the catalytic domain (Pfam:PF00704); this
CC   hinge region is probably mobile, allowing the N-terminal domain
CC   to have different relative positions in solution [1].

AC   PF00379.17
DE   Insect cuticle protein
CC   Many insect cuticular proteins include a 35-36 amino acid motif
CC   known as the R&R consensus. The extensive conservation of this
CC   region led to the suggestion that it functions to bind chitin.
CC   Provocatively, it has no sequence similarity to the well-known
CC   cysteine-containing chitin-binding domain found in chitinases
CC   and some peritrophic membrane proteins. Chitin binding has been
CC   shown experimentally for this region [1]. Thus arthropods have
CC   two distinct classes of chitin binding proteins, those with the

DE   Chloramphenicol resistance gene leader peptide
CC   This family consists of chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance  gene
CC   leader peptides. Inducible resistance to Cm in both  Gram
CC   positive and Gram negative bacteria is controlled  by
CC   translation attenuation. In translation attenuation,	the
CC   ribosome-binding-site (RBS) for the resistance  determinant is
CC   sequestered in a secondary structure domain  within the mRNA.
CC   Preceding the secondary structure is a  short, translated ORF
CC   termed the leader. Ribosome stalling	in the leader causes the

AC   PF05786.8
DE   Condensin complex subunit 2
CC   This family consists of several Barren protein homologues from
CC   several eukaryotic organisms. In Drosophila Barren (barr) is
CC   required for sister-chromatid segregation in mitosis. barr
CC   encodes a novel protein that is present in proliferating cells
CC   and has homologues in yeast and human. Mitotic defects in barr
CC   embryos become apparent during cycle 16, resulting in a loss of
CC   PNS and CNS neurons.	Centromeres move apart at the
CC   metaphase-anaphase transition and Cyclin B is degraded, but
CC   sister chromatids remain connected, resulting in chromatin
CC   bridging. Barren protein localises to chromatin throughout
CC   mitosis. Colocalisation and biochemical experiments indicate
CC   that Barren associates with Topoisomerase II throughout mitosis
CC   and alters the activity of Topoisomerase II. It has been
CC   suggested that this association is required for proper
CC   chromosomal segregation by facilitating the decatenation of
CC   chromatids at anaphase [1]. This family forms one of the three
CC   non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits of the

CC   mitotic condensation complex along with the two SMC protein
CC   families, XCAP-C and XCAP-E, (or in the case of fission yeast,
CC   Cut3 and Cut14). The five-member complex seems to be conserved
CC   from yeasts to vertebrates. This domain is the C-terminal,
CC   cysteine-rich domain of Cnd3. The complex shuttles between the
CC   nucleus, during mitosis, and the cytoplasm during the rest of

DE   2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP or CNPase)
CC   This family consists of the eukaryotic protein 2',3'-cyclic
CC   nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP). 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide
CC   3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is one of the earliest myelin-related
CC   proteins expressed in differentiating oligodendrocytes and
CC   Schwann cells. CNP is abundant in the central nervous system and
CC   in oligodendrocytes. This protein is also found in mammalian
CC   photoreceptor cells, testis and lymphocytes. Although the
CC   biological function of CNP is unknown, it is thought to play a
CC   significant role in the formation of the myelin sheath, where it
CC   comprises 4% of total protein. CNP selectively cleaves
CC   2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides in vitro.
CC   Although physiologically relevant substrates with 2',3'-cyclic
CC   termini are still unknown, numerous cyclic phosphate containing
CC   RNAs occur transiently within eukaryotic cells. Other known
CC   protein families capable of hydrolysing 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides
CC   include tRNA ligases and plant cyclic phosphodiesterases. The
CC   catalytic domains from all these proteins contain two
CC   tetra-peptide motifs H-X-T/S-X, where X is usually a hydrophobic
CC   residue. Mutation of either histidine in CNP abolishes enzymatic
CC   activity [1]. CNPases belong to the 2H phosphoesterase
CC   superfamily. They share a common active site, characterised by
CC   two conserved histidines, with the bacterial tRNA-ligating
CC   enzyme LigT, vertebrate myelin-associated 2',3'
CC   phosphodiesterases, plant Arabidopsis thaliana CPDases and
CC   several several bacteria and virus proteins [2].

DE   Cytochrome oxidase complex assembly protein 1
CC   Coa1 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that associates
CC   with Shy1 and is required for cytochrome oxidase complex IV
CC   assembly. It contains a conserved hydrophobic segment (amino
CC   acids 74-92) with the potential to form a membrane-spanning
CC   helix. The N-terminus of Coa1 is rich in positively charged
CC   amino acids and could form an amphipathic alpha helix,
CC   characteristic of a mitochondrial presequence. A cleavage site
CC   for the mitochondrial processing peptidase is predicted adjacent
CC   to the presequence. Upon in vitro import into mitochondria, Coa1
CC   is processed to a mature form, indicating that it possesses a
CC   cleavable presequence [1]. The eukaryotic cytochrome oxidase
CC   complex consists of 12-13 subunits, with three mitochondrial
CC   encoded subunits, Cox1-Cox3, forming the core enzyme.
CC   Translation of the Cox1 transcript requires the two promoters,
CC   Pet309 and Mss51, and the latter has an additional role in
CC   translational elongation. Coa1 is necessary for linking the
CC   activity of Mss51 to Cox1 insertion into the assembly complex
CC   [2].

CC   families, but recent work on unusual biochemical pathways of
CC   anaerobic bacteria has revealed the existence of a third family
CC   of CoA-transferases. The members of this enzyme family differ in

DE   HEAT repeat associated with sister chromatid cohesion
CC   This HEAT repeat is found most frequently in sister chromatid

DE   Colicin pore forming domain
AC   PF12639.1
DE   DNase/tRNase domain of colicin-like bacteriocin
CC   Colicin-like bacteriocins are complex structures with an
CC   N-terminal beta-barrel translocation domain (Pfam:PF09000), a
CC   long double-alpha-helical receptor-binding domain (Pfam:PF11570)
CC   and this C-terminal RNAse/DNase domain with endonuclease
CC   activity. Their competitor bacteriocidal action is by a process
CC   that involves binding to a surface receptor, entering the cell,
CC   and, finally, killing it. The lethal action of colicin E3 is a
CC   specific cleavage in the ribosomal decoding A site. The crystal
CC   structure of colicin E3 reveals a Y-shaped molecule with the
CC   receptor binding domain forming a 100 Angstrom long stalk and
CC   the two globular heads of the translocation domain and this
CC   catalytic domain comprising the two arms [2].
AC   PF12106.2
DE   Colicin C terminal ribonuclease domain
CC   Colicin is a protein produced by bacteria with Col plasmids. Its
CC   function is to attack E. coli through actions on its inner
CC   membrane ion channels or through ribonuclease or
CC   deoxyribonuclease actions. The C terminal domain is the
CC   ribonuclease domain. It specifically cleaves tRNA anticodons
CC   which recognise codons in the form NAY (N:any nucleotide,
CC   A:adenosine, Y:pyrimidine) which corresponds to Tyrosine,
CC   Histidine, Asparagine and Aspartic Acid. E5-CRD can be referred
CC   to as an RNA restriction enzyme that specifically recognizes and
CC   cleaves single-stranded GU sequences. [1]
AC   PF11429.2
DE   Colicin D
CC   Colicin D is a tRNase which kills sensitive E.coli cells via a
CC   specific tRNA cleavage. It targets the four isoaccepting tRNAs
CC   for Arg and cleaves the phosphodiester bond between positions 38
CC   and 39 at the 3' junction of the anticodon stem and the loop
CC   [1].
AC   PF11504.2
DE   Colicin Ia
CC   Colicins are toxic molecules secreted to kill other bacteria in
CC   times of stress. Colicin Ia kills susceptible E.coli cells by
CC   binding to the colicin I receptor leading to the formation of a
CC   voltage-dependant ion channel. The protein can be divided into
CC   three domains, a translocation domain, a receptor binding domain
CC   and a channel forming domain [1].
AC   PF03857.7
DE   Colicin immunity protein
CC   Colicin immunity proteins are plasmid-encoded proteins necessary
CC   for protecting the cell against colicins. Colicins are toxins
CC   released by bacteria during times of stress [1].
AC   PF09204.4
DE   Bacterial self-protective colicin-like immunity
CC   Colicin D, which is synthesised by various prokaryotes, adopts
CC   an antiparallel four helical bundle fold: the helices are
CC   tightly packed, forming a compact cylindrical molecule. The
CC   protein specifically cleaves the anticodon loop of all four
CC   tRNA-Arg isoacceptors, thereby inactivating prokaryotic protein
CC   synthesis and leading to cell death [1]. This family also
CC   contains immunity proteins to klebicins and microcins. Many
CC   bacteria produce proteins that destroy their competitors.
CC   Colicin D is one such. The immunity proteins are expressed on
CC   the same operon as their cognate bacteriocins and protect the
CC   expressing bacterium from the effects of its own bacteriocin
CC   [2].

DE   Collagen triple helix repeat (20 copies)
CC   Members of this family belong to the collagen superfamily [1].
CC   Collagens are generally extracellular structural proteins
CC   involved in formation of connective tissue structure. The
CC   alignment contains 20 copies of the G-X-Y repeat that forms a
CC   triple helix.  The first position of the repeat is glycine, the
CC   second and third positions can be any residue but are frequently
CC   proline and hydroxyproline.  Collagens are post translationally
CC   modified by proline hydroxylase to form the hydroxyproline
CC   residues. Defective hydroxylation is the cause of scurvy. Some
CC   members of the collagen superfamily are not involved in
CC   connective tissue structure but share the same triple helical
CC   structure.
AC   PF05737.6
DE   Collagen binding domain
CC   The domain fold is a jelly-roll, composed of two antiparallel
CC   beta-sheets and two short alpha-helices [1]. A groove on
CC   beta-sheet I exhibited the best surface complementarity to the
CC   collagen. This site partially overlaps with the peptide sequence
CC   previously shown to be critical for collagen binding.
CC   Recombinant proteins containing single amino acid mutations
CC   designed to disrupt the surface of the putative binding site
CC   exhibited significantly lower affinities for collagen.
AC   PF12904.1
DE   Putative collagen-binding domain of a collagenase 
CC   This domain is likely to be the collagen-binding domain of a

CC   (information derived from TOPSAN).
AC   PF07484.6
DE   Phage Tail Collar Domain
CC   This region is occasionally found in conjunction with
CC   Pfam:PF03335. Most of the family appear to be phage tail
CC   proteins; however some appear to be involved in other processes.
CC   For instance Swiss:Q03314 from Rhizobium leguminosarum may be
CC   involved in plant-microbe interactions ([1]). A related protein
CC   Swiss:Q9L3N1 is involved in the pathogenicity of Microcystis
CC   aeruginosa. The finding of this family in a structural component
CC   of the phage tail fibre baseplate (Swiss:P10930) suggests that
CC   its function is structural rather than enzymatic. Structural
CC   studies show this region consists of a helix and a loop ([2])
CC   and three beta-strands. This alignment does not catch the third
CC   strand as it is separated from the rest of the structure by
CC   around 100 residues. This strand is conserved in homologues but
CC   the intervening sequence is not. Much of the function of
CC   Swiss:P10930 appears to reside in this intervening region. In
CC   the tertiary structure of the phage baseplate this domain forms
CC   part of the 'collar'. The domain may bind SO4, however the
CC   residues accredited with this vary between the PDB file and the
CC   Swiss-Prot entry. The long unconserved region maybe due to
CC   domain swapping in and out of a loop or reflective of rapid
CC   evolution. 
AC   PF01484.11
DE   Nematode cuticle collagen N-terminal domain
CC   The function of this domain is unknown. It is found in the
CC   N-terminal region of nematode cuticle collagens, see
CC   Pfam:PF01391. Cuticle is a tough elastic structure secreted by
CC   hypodermal cells and is primarily composed of collagen proteins
CC   [2].

DE   (2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase (ComA)
CC   In methanobacteria (2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase (ComA)
CC   catalyses the first step of the biosynthesis of coenzyme M from
CC   phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate). This novel enzyme
CC   catalyses the stereospecific Michael addition of sulfite to
CC   P-enolpyruvate, forming L-2-phospho-3-sulfolactate (PSL). It is
CC   suggested that the ComA-catalysed reaction is analogous to those
CC   reactions catalysed by beta-elimination enzymes that proceed
CC   through an enolate intermediate [1].
AC   PF03047.8
DE   COMC family
CC   This family consists exclusively of streptococcal competence
CC   stimulating peptide precursors, which are generally up to 50
CC   amino acid residues long. In all the members of this family, the
CC   leader sequence is cleaved after two conserved glycine residues;
CC   thus the leader sequence is of the double- glycine type [2].
CC   Competence stimulating peptides (CSP) are small (less than 25
CC   amino acid residues) cationic peptides. The N-terminal amino
CC   acid residue is negatively charged, either glutamate or
CC   aspartate. The C-terminal end is positively charged. The third
CC   residue is also positively charged: a highly conserved arginine
CC   [2]. A few COMC proteins and their precursors (not included in
CC   this family) do not fully follow the above description. In
CC   particular: the leader sequence in the CSP precursor from
CC   Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 7863 Swiss:O33758 is not of the
CC   double-glycine type; the CSP from Streptococcus gordonii NCTC
CC   3165 Swiss:O33645 does not have a negatively charged N-terminus
CC   residue and has a lysine instead of arginine at the third
CC   position.  Functionally, CSP act as pheromones, stimulating
CC   competence for genetic transformation in streptococci. In
CC   streptococci, the (CSP mediated) competence response requires
CC   exponential cell growth at a critical density, a relatively
CC   simple requirement when compared to the stationary-phase
CC   requirement of Haemophilus, or the late-logarithmic- phase of
CC   Bacillus [1]. All bacteria induced to competence by a particular
CC   CSP are said to belong to the same pherotype, because each CSP
CC   is recognised by a specific receptor (the signalling domain of a
CC   histidine kinase ComD). Pherotypes are not necessarily
CC   species-specific. In addition, an organism may change pherotype.
CC   There are two possible mechanisms for pherotype switching:
CC   horizontal gene transfer, and accumulation of point mutations.
CC   The biological significance of pherotypes and pherotype
CC   switching is not definitively determined. Pherotype switching
CC   occurs frequently enough in naturally competent streptococci to
CC   suggest that it may be an important contributor to genetic
CC   exchange between different bacterial species [2]. The family
CC   Antibacterial16, streptolysins from group A streptococci, has
CC   been merged into this family.

DE   COMPASS (Complex proteins associated with Set1p) component shg1
CC   The Shg1 subunit is one of the eight subunits of the COMPASS
CC   complex, complex associated with SET1, conserved in yeasts and
CC   in other eukaryotes up to humans. It is associated with the
CC   region of the Set1 protein that is N-terminal to the C-terminus,
CC   ie Set1-560-900. The function of Shg1 seems to be to slightly
CC   inhibit histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) di- and tri-methylation, and
CC   it is a pioneer protein. The COMPASS complex functions to
CC   methylate the fourth lysine of Histone 3 and for silencing of
CC   genes close to the telomeres of chromosomes [3].

AC   PF05952.6
DE   Bacillus competence pheromone ComX
CC   Natural genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by
CC   quorum-sensing (QS). The ComP- ComA two-component system detects
CC   the signalling molecule ComX, and this signal is transduced by a
CC   conserved phosphotransfer mechanism. ComX is synthesised as an

CC   before export to the extracellular environment [1].

CC   structural integrity of chromosomes. Condensin II is made up of
CC   SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) and non-SMC
CC   subunits. The non-SMC subunits bind to the catalytic ends of the
CC   SMC subunit dimer. The condensin holocomplex is able to
CC   introduce superhelical tension into DNA in an ATP hydrolysis-
CC   dependent manner, resulting in the formation of positive

DE   Copper resistance protein B precursor (CopB)
CC   This family consists of several bacterial copper resistance
CC   proteins. Copper is essential and serves as cofactor for more

CC   This family is conserved from plants and fungi to humans. Erv46
CC   works in close conjunction with Erv41 and together they form a

DE   Copper resistance protein K

CC   sites for Cu(I), each with a different affinity for the metal.
CC   Binding of the first Cu(I) ion induces a conformational change
CC   of CopK which involves dissociation of the dimeric apo-protein.
CC   Binding of a second Cu(I) further increases the plasticity of

DE   Corticotropin-releasing factor binding protein (CRF-BP)
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic
CC   corticotropin-releasing factor binding proteins (CRF-BP or

CC   roles in vertebrate species. In mammals, it is the major
CC   hypothalamic releasing factor for pituitary adrenocorticotropin
CC   secretion, and is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator at other

CC   CUE domains have been shown to bind ubiquitin [3-4]. It has been
CC   suggested that CUE domains are related to Pfam:PF00627 [4] and

DE   Cullin protein neddylation domain
CC   This is the neddylation site of cullin proteins which are a
CC   family of structurally related proteins containing an
CC   evolutionarily conserved cullin domain. With the exception of
CC   APC2, each member of the cullin family is modified by Nedd8 and
CC   several cullins function in Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a
CC   process in which the 26S proteasome recognises and subsequently
CC   degrades a target protein tagged with K48-linked poly-ubiquitin
CC   chains. Cullins are molecular scaffolds responsible for
CC   assembling the ROC1/Rbx1 RING-based E3 ubiquitin ligases, of
CC   which several play a direct role in tumorigenesis. Nedd8/Rub1 is
CC   a small ubiquitin-like protein, which was originally found to be
CC   conjugated to Cdc53, a cullin component of the SCF
CC   (Skp1-Cdc53/CUL1-F-box protein) E3 Ub ligase complex in
CC   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Nedd8 modification has now emerged
CC   as a regulatory pathway of fundamental importance for cell cycle
CC   control and for embryogenesis in metazoans. The only identified
CC   Nedd8 substrates are cullins. Neddylation results in covalent
CC   conjugation of a Nedd8 moiety onto a conserved cullin lysine
CC   residue [1].

DE   Curlin associated repeat
CC   This family consists of several bacterial repeats of around 30
CC   residues in length. These repeats are often found in multiple
CC   copies in the curlin proteins CsgA and CsgB. Curli fibres are
CC   thin aggregative surface fibres, connected with adhesion, which
CC   bind laminin, fibronectin, plasminogen, human contact phase
CC   proteins, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
CC   molecules. Curli fibres are coded for by the csg gene cluster,
CC   which is comprised of two divergently transcribed operons. One
CC   operon encodes the csgB, csgA, and csgC genes, while the other
CC   encodes csgD, csgE, csgF, and csgG. The assembly of the fibres
CC   is unique and involves extracellular self-assembly of the curlin
CC   subunit (CsgA), dependent on a specific nucleator protein
CC   (CsgB). CsgD is a transcriptional activator essential for
CC   expression of the two curli fibre operons, and CsgG is an outer
CC   membrane lipoprotein involved in extracellular stabilisation of
CC   CsgA and CsgB [1].

DE   CUT domain
CC   The CUT domain is a DNA-binding motif which can bind

AC   PF11500.2
DE   Spindle-body formation-associated protein
CC   This is the central coiled-coil region of cut12 also found in
CC   other fungi, barring S. cerevisiae. The full protein has two
CC   predicted coiled-coil regions, and one consensus phosphorylation
CC   site for p34cdc2 and two for MAP kinase. During fission yeast
CC   mitosis, the duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) nucleate
CC   microtubule arrays that interdigitate to form the mitotic
CC   spindle. Cut12 is localised to the SPB throughout the cell
CC   cycle, predominantly around the inner face of the interphase
CC   SPB, adjacent to the nucleus [1]. Cut12 associates with Fin1 and
CC   is important in this context for the activity of Plo1 [2].
AC   PF08559.4
DE   Cut8
CC   In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cut8 is a nuclear envelope protein
CC   that physically interacts with and tethers 26S proteasome in the
CC   nucleus resulting in the nuclear accumulation of proteasome [1].
CC   Cut8 is a proteasome substrate and amino terminal residues 1-72
CC   are polyubiquitinated and function as a degron tag.
CC   Ubiquitination of the amino terminal is essential to the
CC   function of Cut8 [1].  Lysine residues in the amino terminal 72
CC   amino acids of Cut8 are required for physical interaction with
CC   proteasome [1].  In fission yeast the function of Cut8 has been
CC   demonstrated to be regulated by ubiquitin-conjugating
CC   Rhp6/Ubc2/Rad6 and ligating enzymes Ubr1 [1].  Cut8 homologs
CC   have been identified in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles
CC   gambiae and Dictyostelium discoideum [1].
AC   PF03091.9
DE   CutA1 divalent ion tolerance protein
CC   Several gene loci with a possible involvement in cellular
CC   tolerance to copper have been identified [1]. One such locus in
CC   eubacteria and  archaebacteria, cutA, is thought to be  involved
CC   in cellular tolerance to a wide variety of divalent cations
CC   other than copper. The cutA locus consists of two operons, of
CC   one and two genes. The CutA1 protein is a cytoplasmic protein,
CC   encoded by the single-gene operon and has been linked to
CC   divalent cation tolerance. It has no recognised structural
CC   motifs [2]. This family also contains putative proteins from
CC   eukaryotes (human and Drosophila).
AC   PF03932.8
DE   CutC family
CC   Copper transport in Escherichia coli is mediated by the products
CC   of at least six genes, cutA, cutB, cutC, cutD, cutE, and cutF. A

CC   Limulus polyphemus. There are 3 isoforms of cuticle  protein 7.
CC   The 3 isoforms are N-terminally blocked but could  be deblocked
CC   by treatment with pyroglutaminase, showing that  the N-terminal
CC   residue is a pyroglutamine residue [1].

DE   Pupal cuticle protein C1
CC   Insect cuticles are composite structures whose mechanical
CC   properties are optimised for biological function.  The major

DE   Cysteine-rich TM module stress tolerance
CC   The members of this family are short cysteine-rich membrane
CC   proteins that most probably dimerise together to form a
CC   transmembrane sulfhydryl-lined pore. The CYSTM module is always
CC   present at the extreme C-terminus of the protein in which it is
CC   present. Furthermore, like the yeast prototypes, the majority of
CC   the proteins also possess a proline/glutamine-rich segment
CC   upstream of the CYSTM module that is likely to form a polar,
CC   disordered head in the cytoplasm. The presence of an atypical
CC   well-conserved acidic residue at the C-terminal end of the TM
CC   helix suggests that this might interact with a positively
CC   charged moiety in the lipid head group. Consistently across the
CC   eukaryotes, the different versions of the CYSTM module appear to
CC   have roles in stress-response or stress-tolerance, and, more
CC   specifically, in resistance to deleterious substances, implying

DE   Dystroglycan (Dystrophin-associated glycoprotein 1)
CC   Dystroglycan is one of the dystrophin-associated glycoproteins,
CC   which is encoded by a 5.5 kb transcript in human. The protein
CC   product is cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits,
CC   [alpha] (N-terminal) and  [beta] (C-terminal). In skeletal
CC   muscle the dystroglycan complex works as a transmembrane linkage
CC   between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton.
CC   [alpha]-dystroglycan is extracellular and binds to merosin
CC   ([alpha]-2 laminin) in the basement membrane, while
CC   [beta]-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein and binds to
CC   dystrophin, which is a large rod-like cytoskeletal protein,
CC   absent in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Dystrophin binds
CC   to intracellular actin cables. In this way, the dystroglycan
CC   complex, which links the extracellular matrix to the
CC   intracellular actin cables, is thought to provide structural
CC   integrity in muscle tissues. The dystroglycan complex is also
CC   known to serve as an agrin receptor in muscle, where it may
CC   regulate agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering at the
CC   neuromuscular junction. There is also evidence which suggests
CC   the function of dystroglycan as a part of the signal
CC   transduction pathway because it is shown that Grb2, a mediator
CC   of the Ras-related signal pathway, can interact with the
CC   cytoplasmic domain of dystroglycan. In general, aberrant
CC   expression of dystrophin-associated protein complex underlies
CC   the pathogenesis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular
CC   dystrophy and severe childhood autosomal recessive muscular
CC   dystrophy. Interestingly, no genetic disease has been described
CC   for either [alpha]- or [beta]-dystroglycan. Dystroglycan is
CC   widely distributed in non-muscle tissues as well as in muscle
CC   tissues. During epithelial morphogenesis of kidney, the
CC   dystroglycan complex is shown to act as a receptor for the

DE   Protein phosphatase inhibitor 1/DARPP-32
CC   This family consists of several mammalian protein phosphatase
CC   inhibitor 1 (IPP-1) and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated neuronal
CC   phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) proteins. Protein phosphatase
CC   inhibitor-1 is involved in signal transduction and is an
CC   endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 [1]. It has been
CC   demonstrated that DARPP-32, if phosphorylated, can inhibit
CC   protein-phosphatase-1 [2]. DARPP-32 has a key role in many
CC   neurotransmitter pathways throughout the brain and has been
CC   shown to be involved in controlling receptors, ion channels and
CC   other physiological factors including the brain's response to
CC   drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, opiates and nicotine. DARPP-32
CC   is reciprocally regulated by the two neurotransmitters that are

CC   Dopamine activates DARPP-32 through the D1 receptor pathway and
CC   disables DARPP-32 through the D2 receptor. Glutamate, acting
CC   through the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, renders DARPP-32
CC   inactive [3]. A mutant form of DARPP-32 has been linked with

DE   Der1-like family
CC   The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the yeast Saccharomyces
CC   cerevisiae contains of proteolytic system able to selectively
CC   degrade misfolded lumenal secretory proteins. For examination of
CC   the components involved in this degradation process, mutants
CC   were isolated. They could be divided into four complementation
CC   groups. The mutations led to stabilisation of two different
CC   substrates for this process. The mutant classes were called
CC   'der' for 'degradation in the ER'. DER1 was cloned by
CC   complementation of the der1-2 mutation. The DER1 gene codes for
CC   a novel, hydrophobic protein, that is localised to the ER.
CC   Deletion of DER1 abolished degradation of the substrate

DE   CRISPR-associated negative autoregulator DevR/Csa2
CC   This group of families is one of several protein families that
CC   are always found associated with prokaryotic CRISPRs, themselves
CC   a family of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
CC   repeats, DNA repeats found in nearly half of all bacterial and
CC   archaeal genomes. These DNA repeat regions have a remarkably
CC   regular structure: unique sequences of constant size, called
CC   spacers, sit between each pair of repeats [2]. It has been shown
CC   that the CRISPRs are virus-derived sequences acquired by the
CC   host to enable them to resist viral infection. The Cas proteins
CC   from the host use the CRISPRs to mediate an antiviral response.
CC   After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins
CC   termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and
CC   retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived
CC   sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR
CC   RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to
CC   interfere with virus proliferation [3]. Cas5 contains an
CC   endonuclease motif, whose inactivation leads to loss of
CC   resistance, even in the presence of phage-derived spacers [4].

DE   Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)
CC   This family consists of several mammalian dentin matrix protein
CC   1 (DMP1) sequences. The dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1
CC   (DMP1) gene has been mapped to human chromosome 4q21 [1]. DMP1
CC   is a bone and teeth specific protein initially identified from
CC   mineralised dentin.  DMP1 is primarily localised in the nuclear
CC   compartment of undifferentiated osteoblasts. In the nucleus,
CC   DMP1 acts as a transcriptional component for activation of

CC   phase of osteoblast maturation, Ca(2+) surges into the nucleus
CC   from the cytoplasm, triggering the phosphorylation of DMP1 by a
CC   nuclear isoform of casein kinase II. This phosphorylated DMP1 is
CC   then exported out into the extracellular matrix, where it
CC   regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite. DMP1 is a unique
CC   molecule that initiates osteoblast differentiation by
CC   transcription in the nucleus and orchestrates mineralised matrix
CC   formation extracellularly, at later stages of osteoblast
CC   maturation [2]. The DMP1 gene has been found to be ectopically

DE   Replication initiation and membrane attachment
CC   This family consists of several bacterial replication initiation
CC   and membrane attachment (DnaB) proteins, as well as DnaD which
CC   is a component of the PriA primosome.  The PriA primosome
CC   functions to recruit the replication fork helicase onto the DNA

CC   filaments catalyse the homology-dependent formation of joint
CC   molecules. While the E.coli SSB protein limits access of RecA to
CC   ssDNA, DprA alleviates this barrier. It is proposed that DprA is
CC   a new member of the recombination-mediator protein family,
CC   dedicated to natural bacterial transformation [2].

DE   Cytosine specific DNA methyltransferase replication foci domain
CC   This domain is part of a cytosine specific DNA methyltransferase
CC   enzyme. It functions non-catalytically to target the protein
CC   towards replication foci. This allows the DNMT1 protein to
CC   methylate the correct residues. This domain targets DMAP1 and

CC   The dockerin repeat is the binding partner of the cohesin domain
CC   Pfam:PF00963. The cohesin-dockerin interaction is the crucial

DE   Erythronolide synthase docking
CC   The N terminal docking domain found in modular polyketide
CC   synthase assumes an alpha-helical structure, wherein two

DE   DOMON domain
CC   The DOMON (named after dopamine beta-monooxygenase N-terminal)
CC   domain is 110-125 residues long. It is predicted to form an all
CC   beta fold with up to 11 strands and is secreted to the
CC   extracellular compartment. The beta-strand folding produces a
CC   hydrophobic pocket which appears to bind soluble haem. This is
CC   consistent with the predominant architectures where the protein
CC   is associated with cytochromes or enzymatic domains whose
CC   activity involves redox or electron transfer reactions
CC   potentially as a direct participant in the electron transfer
CC   process. The DOMON domain superfamily, of which this is just one
CC   member, shows (1) multiple hydrophobic residues that contribute
CC   to the hydrophobic core of the strands of the beta-sandwich, and
CC   small residues found at the boundaries of strands and loops, (2)
CC   a strongly conserved charged residue (usually arginine/lysine)
CC   at the end of strand 9, which possibly stabilises the loop
CC   between 9 and 10, and (3) a polar residue (usually histidine,
CC   lysine or arginine), that interacts or coordinates with ligands
CC   [1]. The suggested superfamily includes both haem- and
CC   sugar-binding members: the haem-binding families being the
CC   ethyl-Benzoate dehydrogenase family EB_dh, Pfam:PF09459, the
CC   cellobiose dehydrogenase family CBDH and this family, and the
CC   sugar-binding families being the xylanases, CBM_4_9,
CC   Pfam:PF02018. The common feature of the superfamily is the

CC   alpha-helical structure however in aqueous solution it consists
CC   of a random coil. The alpha helical segment can adopt a

DE   Dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory protein (DPM2)
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic dolichol
CC   phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory (DPM2) proteins.
CC   Biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol and N-glycan
CC   precursor is dependent upon a mannosyl donor, dolichol
CC   phosphate-mannose (DPM). DPM2, an 84 amino acid membrane protein
CC   expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), makes a complex
CC   with DPM1 that is essential for the ER localisation and stable
CC   expression of DPM1. Moreover, DPM2 enhances binding of dolichol
CC   phosphate, a substrate of DPM synthase. Biosynthesis of DPM in

CC   that may be functionally important. This domain is the N
CC   terminal domain of DNA polymerase epsilon subunit B. It forms a
CC   primarily alpha helical structure in which four helices are
CC   arranged in two hairpins with connecting loops containing beta
CC   strands which form a short parallel sheet. DNA polymerase

DE   Q-cell neuroblast polarisation
CC   Dyp-19, formerly known as DUF2211, is a transmembrane domain
CC   family that is required to orient the neuroblast cells, QR and
CC   QL accurately on the anterior-posterior axis: QL and QR are born
CC   in the same anterior-posterior position, but polarise and
CC   migrate left-right asymmetrically, QL migrating towards the
CC   posterior and QR migrating towards the anterior. It is also
CC   required, with unc-40, to express mab-5 correctly in the Q cell

DE   Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT)
CC   This family consists of several bacterial dinitrogenase
CC   reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase (DRAT) proteins. Members of
CC   this family seem to be specific to Rhodospirillum, Rhodobacter
CC   and Azospirillum species. Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyl
CC   transferase (DRAT) carries out the transfer of the ADP-ribose
CC   from NAD to the Arg-101 residue of one subunit of the
CC   dinitrogenase reductase homodimer, resulting in inactivation of
CC   that enzyme. Dinitrogenase reductase-activating glycohydrolase
CC   (DRAG) removes the ADP-ribose group attached to dinitrogenase
CC   reductase, thus restoring nitrogenase activity. The DRAT-DRAG
CC   system negatively regulates nitrogenase activity in response to
CC   exogenous NH4+ or energy limitation in the form of a shift to
CC   darkness or to anaerobic conditions [1].
AC   PF11719.2
DE   DNA replication and checkpoint protein
CC   Genome duplication is precisely regulated by cyclin-dependent
CC   kinases CDKs, which bring about the onset of S phase by
CC   activating replication origins and then prevent relicensing of
CC   origins until mitosis is completed. The optimum sequence motif
CC   for CDK phosphorylation is S/T-P-K/R-K/R, and Drc1-Sld2 is found
CC   to have at least 11 potential phosphorylation sites. Drc1 is
CC   required for DNA synthesis and S-M replication checkpoint
CC   control. Drc1 associates with Cdc2 and is phosphorylated at the
CC   onset of S phase when Cdc2 is activated. Thus Cdc2 promotes DNA
CC   replication by phosphorylating Drc1 and regulating its
CC   association with Cut5 [1]. Sld2 and Sld3 represent the minimal
CC   set of S-CDK substrates required for DNA replication [2].

DE   DsrC like protein
CC   Family member Swiss:P45573 has been observed to co-purify with 
CC   Desulfovibrio vulgaris dissimilatory sulfite reductase [1], and
CC   many	members of this family are annotated as the third (gamma)
CC   subunit of  dissimilatory sulphite reductase. However, this
CC   protein appears to be only loosely associated to the	sulfite
CC   reductase, which suggests that DsrC may not be an integral part
CC   of the dissimilatory sulphite reductase.  Members of this family
CC   are found in organisms such as E. coli and H. influenzae which
CC   do not contain  dissimilatory sulphite reductases but can
CC   synthesise assimilatory sirohaem  sulphite and nitrite
CC   reductases.  It is speculated that DsrC may be  involved in the
CC   assembly, folding or stabilisation of sirohaem proteins [2]. 
CC   The strictly conserved cysteine in the C terminus suggests that
CC   DsrC may have a catalytic function in the metabolism of sulphur
CC   compounds [3].

CC   This bacterial family of proteins shows structural similarity to
CC   other pectin lyase families. Although structures from this
CC   family align with acetyl-transferases, there is no conservation
CC   of catalytic residues found. It is likely that the function is
CC   one of cell-adhesion. In PDB:3jx8, it is interesting to note
CC   that the sequence of contains several well defined sequence
CC   repeats, centred around GSG motifs defining the tight beta turn
CC   between the two sheets of the super-helix; there are 8 such
CC   repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein, which could be
CC   grouped into 4 repeats of two.  It seems likely that this family
CC   belongs to the superfamily of trimeric autotransporter adhesins
CC   (TAAs), which are important virulence factors in Gram-negative
CC   pathogens [1] [2].  In the case of Parabacteroides distasonis,
CC   which is a cmoponent of the normal distal human gut microbiota,
CC   TAA-like complexes probably modulate adherence to the host
CC   (information derived from TOPSAN).

DE   Domain of unknown function DUF29
CC   This family consists of various hypothetical proteins from
CC   cyanobacteria, none of which are functionally described. The
CC   aligned region is approximately 120-140 amino acids long
CC   corresponding to almost the entire length of the proteins in the
CC   family. Swiss:Q2RPE2, PDB:3fcn, is a small protein that has a
CC   novel all-alpha fold. The N-terminal helical hairpin is likely
CC   to function as a dimerisation module. This protein is a member
CC   of PFam family PF01724. The function of this protein is unknown.
CC   One protein sequence contains a fusion of this protein and a
CC   DnaB domain, suggesting a possible role in DNA helicase activity
CC   (hypothetical). Dali hits have low Z and high rmsd, suggesting
CC   probably only topological similarities (not functional

DE   Protein of unknown function (DUF3108)
CC   This is a bacterial family of putative lipoproteins. The
CC   structure for Swiss:Q64U78, PDB:3fzx, the first structural
CC   template for this large family including several homologues in
CC   the human gut microbiome and in metagenomic datasets, folds into
CC   a beta barrel that topologically looks like a small-scale porin
CC   (such as FepA). Swiss:Q64U78 is a putative exported protein, and
CC   this fold is of the YmcC-like type, with a predicted signal
CC   peptide SpI cleavage site AGAMA|QNQDC, and a Phobius server
CC   prediction of non-cytoplasmic localisation for amino acids
CC   21-236. The possibility of it being a membrane protein can be
CC   ruled out by the hydrophilic nature of the solvent exposed
CC   surface outside the barrels. Analysis of sequence conservation
CC   suggests that an area near Glu172/Trp206 is potentially
CC   interesting. These two residues are also conserved in Dali hit
CC   PDB:2in5, a hypothetical lipoprotein classified as a new
CC   YmcC-like fold in SCOP (SCOP:159271, with a 12-stranded meander
CC   beta-sheet folded into a deformed beta-barrel) despite large
CC   structural differences between the two structures, suggesting
CC   similarity in function.

AC   PF01207.11
DE   Dihydrouridine synthase (Dus)
CC   Members of this family catalyse the reduction of the 5,6-double

CC   of tRNA is widely observed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and
CC   also in some archae.	Most dihydrouridines are found in the D
CC   loop of t-RNAs.  The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently

CC   tRNA. It is likely that different family members have different
CC   substrate specificities, which may overlap.  Dus 1
CC   (Swiss:Q9HGN6) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts on
CC   pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 (Swiss:P53720) acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr
CC   and pre-tRNA-Leu.  Dus 1 is active as a single subunit,
CC   requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of

CC   the gene coding for this protein in humans give rise to the
CC   disorder Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC, MIM 223800)
CC   which is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterised by the
CC   association of a spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia and mental
CC   retardation [1]. DYM transcripts are widely expressed throughout
CC   human development and Dymeclin is not an integral membrane
CC   protein of the ER, but rather a peripheral membrane protein
CC   dynamically associated with the Golgi apparatus [2].

DE   Dynein heavy chain and region D6 of dynein motor
CC   This family represents the C-terminal region of dynein heavy
CC   chain.  The chain also contains ATPase activity and microtubule
CC   binding ability and acts as a motor for the movement of
CC   organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynein is also
CC   involved in cilia and flagella movement. The dynein subunit
CC   consists of at least two heavy chains and a number of
CC   intermediate and light chains [1]. The 380 kDa motor unit of
CC   dynein belongs to the AAA class of chaperone-like ATPases. The
CC   core of the 380 kDa motor unit contains a concatenated chain of
CC   six AAA modules, of which four correspond to the ATP binding
CC   sites with P-loop signatures described previously, and two are
CC   modules in which the P loop has been lost in evolution. This
CC   C-terminal domain carries the D6 region of the dynein motor
CC   where the P-loop has been lost in evolution but the general
CC   structure of a potential ATP binding site appears to be retained
CC   [2].
AC   PF11540.2
DE   Cytoplasmic dynein 1 intermediate chain 2
CC   Intermediate chain IC 2 forms part of the complex cytoplasmic
CC   dynein 1 along with a heavy chain (HC), two light intermediate
CC   chains (LICs) and three light chains (LCs). The complex is
CC   responsible for hydrolysing ATP to generate force toward the
CC   minus end of microtubules [1]. IC binds to the HC via the N
CC   terminal binding domain on the HC and ICs contain binding sites
CC   for the LCs. The ICs are responsible for binding to kinetochores
CC   and the Golgi apparatus through an interaction with the
CC   p150Glued subunit of dynactin which is another complex [1].

DE   Dysbindin (Dystrobrevin binding protein 1)
CC   Dysbindin is an evolutionary conserved 40-kDa
CC   coiled-coil-containing protein that binds to alpha- and
CC   beta-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain. Dystrophin and
CC   alpha-dystrobrevin are co-immunoprecipitated with dysbindin,
CC   indicating that dysbindin is DPC-associated in muscle. Dysbindin
CC   co-localises with alpha-dystrobrevin at the sarcolemma and is
CC   up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle. In the brain,
CC   dysbindin is found primarily in axon bundles and especially in
CC   certain axon terminals, notably mossy fibre synaptic terminals
CC   in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Dysbindin may have
CC   implications for the molecular pathology of Duchenne muscular
CC   dystrophy and may provide an alternative route for anchoring
CC   dystrobrevin and the DPC to the muscle membrane [1]. Genetic
CC   variation in the  human dysbindin gene is also thought to be
CC   associated with Schizophrenia [2].

CC   having increased binding efficiency. The crystal structure of an
CC   E2F4-DP2-DNA complex shows  that the DNA-binding domains of the

CC   sequence in its TSG101 domain) and ALIX. This is the domain on
CC   CEP55 which binds to both TSG101 and ALIX. It also acts as a
CC   hinge between the N and C termini. This domain is called EABR.

DE   RNA polymerase II transcription elongation factor
CC   Members of this family act as transcriptional transactivators of
CC   ELL and ELL2 elongation activities [1][2][3][4]. Eaf proteins
CC   form a stable heterodimer complex with ELL proteins to
CC   facilitate the binding of RNA polymerase II to activate
CC   transcription elongation. The N-terminus of approx 120 residues
CC   is globular and highly conserved [5].
AC   PF00563.14
DE   EAL domain
CC   This domain is found in diverse bacterial signaling proteins. 
CC   It is called EAL after its conserved residues. The EAL domain is
CC   a good candidate for a diguanylate phosphodiesterase function
CC   [1]. The domain contains many conserved acidic residues  that
CC   could participate in metal binding and might form the

DE   EAP30/Vps36 family
CC   This family includes EAP30 as well as the Vps36 protein. Vps36
CC   is involved in Golgi to endosome trafficking.  EAP30 is a
CC   subunit of the ELL complex.  The ELL is an 80-kDa RNA polymerase
CC   II transcription factor.  ELL interacts with three other
CC   proteins to form the complex known as ELL complex.  The ELL
CC   complex is capable of increasing that catalytic rate of
CC   transcription elongation, but is unable to repress initiation of
CC   transcription by RNA polymerase II as is the case of ELL. EAP30
CC   is thought to lead to the derepression of ELL's transcriptional
CC   inhibitory activity [1].

DE   E2F-associated phosphoprotein
CC   This entry represents the conserved C-terminal portion of an E2F
CC   binding protein. E2F transcription factors play an essential
CC   role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and their activity is
CC   frequently deregulated in human cancers. E2F activity is
CC   regulated by a variety of mechanisms, frequently mediated by
CC   proteins binding to individual members or a subgroup of the
CC   family. EAPP interacts with a subset of E2F factors and
CC   influences E2F-dependent promoter activity. EAPP is present
CC   throughout the cell cycle but disappears during mitosis [1].

AC   PF03271.11
DE   EB1-like C-terminal motif
CC   This motif is found at the C-terminus of proteins that are
CC   related to the EB1 protein.  The EB1 proteins contain an
CC   N-terminal CH domain Pfam:PF00307. The human EB1 protein was
CC   originally discovered as a protein interacting with the
CC   C-terminus of the APC protein. This interaction is often
CC   disrupted in colon cancer, due to deletions affecting the  APC
CC   C-terminus. Several EB1 orthologues are also included in this
CC   family.  The interaction between EB1 and APC has been shown to
CC   have a potent synergistic effect on microtubule polymerisation.
CC   Neither of EB1 or APC alone has this effect. It is thought that
CC   EB1 targets APC to the + ends of microtubules, where APC
CC   promotes microtubule polymerisation. This process is regulated
CC   by APC phosphorylation by Cdc2, which disrupts APC-EB1 binding.
CC   Human EB1 protein can functionally substitute for the yeast EB1
CC   homologue Mal3. In addition, Mal3 can substitute for human EB1
CC   in promoting microtubule polymerisation with APC.

CC   sterol acceptor site and the catalytic centre, which show
CC   Delta8-Delta7 sterol isomerase activity. Human sterol isomerase,
CC   a homologue of mouse EBP, is suggested not only to play a role
CC   in cholesterol biosynthesis, but also to affect lipoprotein
CC   internalisation. In humans, mutations of EBP are known to cause
CC   the genetic disorder of X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia

CC   is directed towards their detoxification capacity for epoxides
CC   since they are important safeguards against the cytotoxic and

DE   delta endotoxin, N-terminal domain
CC   This family contains insecticidal toxins produced by Bacillus
CC   species of bacteria.	During spore formation the bacteria
CC   produce crystals of this protein.  When an insect ingests these
CC   proteins they are activated by proteolytic cleavage.	The N
CC   terminus is cleaved in all of the proteins and a C terminal
CC   extension is cleaved in some members.  Once activated the 
CC   endotoxin binds to the gut epithelium and causes cell lysis
CC   leading to death.  This activated region of the delta endotoxin
CC   is composed of three structural domains.  The N-terminal helical
CC   domain is involved in membrane insertion and pore formation. 
CC   The second and third domains are involved in receptor binding.

CC   the bacteriophage protein endosialidase. The two N-terminal
CC   domains (this domain and the beta propeller) assemble in the
CC   compact 'cap' whereas the C-terminal domain forms an extended
CC   tail-like structure. The very N-terminal part of the 'cap'
CC   region (residues 246 to 312) holds the only alpha-helix of the

CC   endosialidase protein forms homotrimeric molecules and this
CC   domain complexes into a tail-spike stalk. The stalk region folds
CC   in a triple beta-helix that is interrupted by a small triple
CC   beta-prism domain. The tail-spike is a multifunctional protein
CC   device used by the phage to fulfill the following functions: (i)
CC   to adsorb to the bacterial polySia capsule (ii) to de-polymerise
CC   the capsule to gain access to the outer bacterial membrane, and

DE   Enterocin A Immunity
CC   Gram-positive lactobacilli produce bacteriocins to kill

CC   from the bacteriocidal activity of this molecule they co-express
CC   an immunity protein (for discussion of this operon see
CC   Bacteriocin_IIc Pfam:PF10439). The immunity protein structure is
CC   a soluble, cytoplasmic, antiparallel four alpha-helical globular
CC   bundle with a fifth, more flexible and more divergent C-terminal
CC   helical hair-pin [2]. The C-terminal hair-pin recognises the
CC   C-terminus of the producer bacteriocin and this interaction is
CC   sufficient to dis-orient the bacteriocin within the membrane and
CC   close up the permeabilising pore that on its own the bacteriocin

CC   of two mutually exclusive conformations, one of which is
CC   postulated to form in the absence of induction, and to contain
CC   two rho factor-independent terminators. [1].

DE   Nuclear protein Es2
CC   This entry is of a family of proteins of approximately 500
CC   residues with alternating regions of low complexity and
CC   conservation where the domain similarities are strong.  Apart
CC   from a predicted coiled-coil domain, no other known functional
CC   domains have been characterised. The protein appears to be
CC   expressed in the nucleus and particularly highly in the pons
CC   sub-region of the brain. The protein is clearly necessary for
CC   normal development of the nervous system [1].
AC   PF03238.7
DE   ESAG protein
CC   Expression-site-associated gene (ESAG) proteins are thought  to
CC   be involved in VSG activation. This family includes ESAG 117A
CC   Swiss:P04477 as well as ESAG IM Swiss: Q26705.

DE   ESCRT-II complex subunit
CC   This family of conserved eukaryotic proteins are subunits of the
CC   endosome associated complex ESCRT-II which recruits transport
CC   machinery for protein sorting at the multivesicular body (MVB)
CC   [1].	This protein complex transiently associates with the
CC   endosomal membrane and thereby initiates the formation of
CC   ESCRT-III, a membrane-associated protein complex that functions
CC   immediately downstream of ESCRT-II during sorting of MVB cargo.
CC   ESCRT-II in turn functions downstream of ESCRT-I, a protein
CC   complex that binds to ubiquitinated endosomal cargo [1].
AC   PF03433.7
DE   EspA-like secreted protein 
CC   EspA is the prototypical member of this family. EspA, together
CC   with EspB, EspD and Tir are exported by a type III secretion
CC   system.  These proteins are essential for attaching and effacing
CC   lesion formation. EspA is a structural protein and a major
CC   component of a large, transiently expressed, filamentous surface
CC   organelle which forms a direct link between the bacterium and
CC   the host cell [1,2].

CC   EPEC pathogenesis [1]. EspB is also found in Citrobacter
CC   rodentium [2].
AC   PF04806.6
DE   EspF protein repeat
CC   The enteropathogenic Escherichia coli EspF secreted protein
CC   induces host cell apoptosis. Its proline-rich structure suggests
CC   that it may act by binding to SH3 domains or EVH1 domains of
CC   host cell signalling proteins [1]. 
AC   PF06872.5
DE   EspG protein
CC   This family consists of several EspG like proteins from
CC   Citrobacter rodentium and Escherichia coli. EspG is secreted by
CC   the type III secretory system and is translocated into host
CC   epithelial cells. EspG is homologous with Shigella flexneri
CC   protein VirA and can rescue invasion in a Shigella virA mutant,
CC   indicating that these proteins are functionally equivalent in
CC   Shigella.  EspG plays an accessory but as yet undefined role in
CC   EPEC virulence that may involve intestinal colonisation [1].

DE   Oestrogen-type nuclear receptor final C-terminal 
CC   This is the very C-terminal region of a subfamily of nuclear
CC   receptors that includes oestrogen receptors and other subfamily
CC   3 group A members. The actual function of this region is not
CC   known, but the domain is absent from all the other types of
CC   nuclear receptors. Oestrogen receptors modulate AP-1-dependent
CC   transcription [1] through two distinct mechanisms: via
CC   protein-protein interactions on DNA; and via non-genomic
CC   actions. The mechanism used depends on the cellular localisation
CC   of the receptor. In addition to the more extensively studied
CC   cross-talk on DNA, additional non-genomic actions might be very
CC   important in target tissues in which membrane-associated ERs are
CC   found. These non-genomic actions probably contribute to the
CC   overall physiological responses mediated by ligand-bound ERs [2]
CC   and might possibly be mediated via this C-terminal domain.

DE   Firmicute eSAT-6 protein secretion system EssA
CC   The Wss (WXG100 protein secretion system) in S. aureus seems to
CC   be encoded by a locus of eight ORFs, called ess (eSAT-6
CC   secretion system). This locus encodes, amongst several other
CC   proteins, EssA, a protein predicted to possess one transmembrane
CC   domain. Due to its predicted membrane location and its absolute
CC   requirement for WXG100 protein secretion, it has been speculated
CC   that EssA could form a secretion apparatus in conjunction with
CC   YukC and YukAB. Proteins homologous to EssA, YukC, EsaA and YukD
CC   were absent from mycobacteria [1].

DE   Virulence factor EsxB
CC   The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus secretes EsxA and EsxB,
CC   ESAT-6-like proteins, across the bacterial envelope.
CC   Staphylococcal esxA and esxB are clustered with six other genes
CC   and some of these are required for synthesis or secretion of
CC   EsxA and EsxB. Mutants that failed to secrete EsxA and EsxB
CC   displayed defects in the pathogenesis of S. aureus murine
CC   abscesses, suggesting that this specialised secretion system
CC   might be a general strategy of human bacterial pathogenesis [1].

DE   ET module
CC   This domain has no known function. It is found in several C.
CC   elegans proteins. The domain contains 8-10 conserved cysteines
CC   that probably form 4-5 disulphide bridges. By inspection of the
CC   conservation of cysteines it looks like cysteines 1,2,3,4,9 and
CC   10 are always present and that sometimes the pair 5 and 8 or the
CC   pair 6 and 7 are missing. This suggests that cysteines 5/8 and

DE   Euplotes octocarinatus mating pheromone protein
CC   This family consists of several mating pheromone proteins from
CC   Euplotes octocarinatus. Cells of the ten mating types of the
CC   ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus communicate by pheromones before
CC   they enter conjugation. The pheromones induce homotypic pairing
CC   when applied to mating types that do not secrete the same
CC   pheromone(s). Heterotypic pairs (i.e., those between cells of
CC   different mating types) are formed only when both mating types
CC   in a mixture secrete a pheromone that the other does not. The
CC   genetics of mating types is based on four codominant mating type
CC   alleles, each allele determining production of a different
CC   pheromone. The pheromones not only induce pair formation but
CC   also attract cells [1].

DE   EURL protein
CC   This family consists of several animal EURL proteins. EURL is

CC   part of the dorsal retina. EURL transcripts are also detected in
CC   the lens at stage 18 and remain abundant in the proliferating
CC   epithelial cells of the lens until at least day 11. The

CC   (PDB: 2HD3). The structure also contains three additional
CC   beta-strands, which help the formation of a tight hexamer, with
CC   a hole in the center. this suggests that EutN forms a pore, with

DE   Excisionase-like protein
CC   The phage-encoded excisionase protein (Xis, Swiss:P03699) is
CC   involved in excisive recombination by regulating the assembly of

CC   adopts an unusual 'winged'-helix structure in which two alpha
CC   helices are packed against two extended strands.  Also present
CC   in the structure is a two-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet,
CC   whose strands are connected by a four-residue 'wing'.  During
CC   interaction with DNA, helix alpha2 is thought to insert into the
CC   major groove, while the wing contacts the adjacent minor groove
CC   or phosphodiester backbone. The C-terminal region of Xis is
CC   involved in interaction with phage-encoded integrase (Int), and
CC   a putative C-terminal alpha helix may fold upon interaction with

DE   Excalibur calcium-binding domain
CC   Extracellular Ca2+-dependent nuclease YokF from Bacillus
CC   subtilis and several other surface-exposed proteins from diverse
CC   bacteria are encoded in the genomes in two paralogous forms that
CC   differ by a ~45 amino acid fragment, which comprises a novel
CC   conserved domain. Sequence analysis of this domain revealed a
CC   conserved DxDxDGxxCE motif, which is strikingly similar to the
CC   Ca2+-binding loop of the calmodulin-like EF-hand domains,
CC   suggesting an evolutionary relationship between them. Functions
CC   of many of the other proteins in which the novel domain, named
CC   Excalibur (extracellular calcium-binding region), is found, as
CC   well as a structural model of its conserved motif are consistent
CC   with the notion that the Excalibur domain binds calcium. This
CC   domain is but one more example of the diversity of structural
CC   contexts surrounding the EF-hand-like calcium-binding loop in

DE   Exo70 exocyst complex subunit
CC   The Exo70 protein forms one subunit of the exocyst complex.
CC   First discovered in S. cerevisiae [1], Exo70 and other exocyst

CC   Exo70 interacts with the Rho3 GTPase [4]. This interaction
CC   mediates one of the three known functions of Rho3 in cell
CC   polarity: vesicle docking and fusion with the plasma membrane
CC   (the other two functions are regulation of actin polarity and
CC   transport of exocytic vesicles from the mother cell to the bud)
CC   [3]. In humans, the functions of Exo70 and the exocyst complex

DE   EXS family
CC   We have named this region the EXS family after (ERD1, XPR1, and
CC   SYG1). This family includes C-terminus portions from the SYG1
CC   G-protein associated signal transduction protein from
CC   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and sequences that are thought to be
CC   murine leukaemia virus (MLV)	receptors (XPR1). N-terminus
CC   portions from these proteins are aligned in the SPX 
CC   Pfam:PF03105 family. The previously noted similarity between
CC   SYG1 and MLV receptors over their whole sequences [1] is thus
CC   borne out in Pfam:PF03105 and this family. While the N-termini
CC   aligned in Pfam:PF03105 are thought to be involved in signal
CC   transduction, the role of the C-terminus sequences aligned in
CC   this family is not known. This region of similarity contains
CC   several predicted transmembrane helices. This family also
CC   includes the ERD1 (ERD: ER retention	defective) yeast proteins
CC   Swiss:P16151.  ERD1 proteins are involved in the localisation of
CC   endogenous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins. erd1 null
CC   mutants secrete such proteins even though they possess the
CC   C-terminal HDEL ER lumen localisation label sequence. In
CC   addition, null mutants also exhibit defects in the
CC   Golgi-dependent processing of several glycoproteins, which led
CC   to the suggestion that the sorting of luminal ER proteins
CC   actually occurs in the Golgi, with subsequent return of these
CC   proteins to the ER via  `salvage' vesicles [2].

DE   Euplotes raikovi mating pheromone
CC   This family consists of several Euplotes raikovi mating
CC   pheromone proteins. Diffusible polypeptide pheromones, which
CC   distinguish otherwise morphologically identical vegetative cell
CC   types from one another, are produced by some species of
CC   ciliates. In the marine sand-dwelling protozoan ciliate Euplotes
CC   raikovi, pheromone molecules promote the vegetative reproduction
CC   (mitogenic proliferation or growth) of the same cells from which
CC   they originate. As, understandably, such autocrine pheromone
CC   activity is primary to that of targeting and inducing a foreign

DE   Fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase family
CC   This family consists of fumarylacetoacetate (FAA) hydrolase,	or

CC   isomerase/OPET decarboxylase from E. coli strain W.	 FAA is
CC   the last enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, it hydrolyses

CC   tyrosinemia in humans this is an inherited disorder mainly
CC   affecting the liver leading to  liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular

DE   FadR C-terminal domain
CC   This family contains sequences that are similar to the fatty
CC   acid metabolism regulator protein (FadR, Swiss:P09371). This
CC   functions as a dimer, with each monomer being composed of an
CC   N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a regulatory C-terminal
CC   domain. A linker comprising two short alpha helices joins the

CC   six alpha helices forms a barrel-like structure, while a seventh
CC   alpha helix forms a 'lid' at the end closest to the N-terminal
CC   domain. This structure was found to be similar to that of the
CC   C-terminal domain of the Tet repressor. Long-chain acyl-CoA

CC   dimerises into a curved structure that binds to liposomes and
CC   either senses or induces the curvature of the membrane bilayer
CC   to cause biophysical changes to the shape of the bilayer; it
CC   also thereby recruits other trafficking factors, such as the

CC   pombe is a ferric reductase component and is required for cell
CC   surface ferric reductase activity, mutants in frp1 are deficient
CC   in ferric iron uptake [1]. Cytochrome B-245 heavy chain
CC   Swiss:P04839 is a FAD-dependent dehydrogenase it is also has

DE   FEZ-like protein
CC   This is a family of eukaryotic proteins thought to be involved
CC   in axonal outgrowth and fasciculation [1]. The N-terminal
CC   regions of these sequences are less conserved than the
CC   C-terminal regions, and are highly acidic [1].  The C. elegans
CC   homolog, UNC-76 (Swiss:Q7JNU9), may play structural and
CC   signalling roles in the control of axonal extension and adhesion
CC   (particularly in the presence of adjacent neuronal cells [2])
CC   and these roles have also been postulated for other FEZ family
CC   proteins [1]. Certain homologs have been definitively found to
CC   interact with the N-terminal variable region (V1) of PKC-zeta,
CC   and this interaction causes cytoplasmic translocation of the FEZ
CC   family protein in mammalian neuronal cells [2]. The C-terminal
CC   region probably participates in the association with the
CC   regulatory domain of PKC-zeta [2]. The members of this family
CC   are predicted to form coiled-coil structures [2,3], which may
CC   interact with members of the RhoA family of signalling proteins
CC   [2], but are not thought to contain other characteristic protein
CC   motifs [3]. Certain members of this family are expressed almost

AC   PF03781.10
DE   Formylglycine-generating sulfatase enzyme
CC   This domain is found in eukaryotic proteins [1] required for
CC   post-translational sulphatase modification (SUMF1).  These
CC   proteins are associated with the rare disorder multiple
CC   sulphatase deficiency (MSD) [2]. The protein product of the
CC   SUMF1 gene is FGE, formylglycine (FGly),-generating enzyme,
CC   which is a sulfatase. Sulfatases are enzymes essential for
CC   degradation and remodelling of sulfate esters, and formylglycine
CC   (FGly), the key catalytic in the active site, is unique to
CC   sulfatases [3]. FGE is localised to the endoplasmic reticulum
CC   (ER) and interacts with and modifies the unfolded form of newly
CC   synthesised sulfatases. FGE is a single-domain monomer with a
CC   surprising paucity of secondary structure that adopts a unique
CC   fold which is stabilised by two Ca2+ ions. The effect of all
CC   mutations found in MSD patients is explained by the FGE
CC   structure, providing a molecular basis for MSD. A redox-active
CC   disulfide bond is present in the active site of FGE. An oxidised
CC   cysteine residue, possibly cysteine sulfenic acid, has been
CC   detected that may allow formulation of a structure-based
CC   mechanism for FGly formation from cysteine residues in all
CC   sulfatases [4].

DE   Fibroblast growth factor
CC   Fibroblast growth factors are a family of proteins involved in

CC   [2]. Most share an internal core region of high similarity,
CC   conserved residues in which are involved in binding with their
CC   receptors. On binding, they cause dimerisation of their tyrosine
CC   kinase receptors leading to intracellular signalling. There are
CC   currently four known tyrosine kinase receptors for fibroblast
CC   growth factors.  These receptors can each bind several different
CC   members of this family.  Members of this family have a beta
CC   trefoil structure. Most have N-terminal signal peptides and are
CC   secreted. A few lack signal sequences but are secreted anyway;
CC   still others also lack the signal peptide but are found on the
CC   cell surface and within the extracellular matrix. A third group
CC   remain intracellular [2]. They have central roles in

DE   Fibritin C-terminal region
CC   This family features sequences bearing similarity to the
CC   C-terminal portion of the bacteriophage T4 protein fibritin
CC   (Swiss:P10104). This protein is responsible for attachment of
CC   long tail fibres to virus particle, and forms the 'whiskers' or
CC   fibres on the neck of the virion. The region seen in this family
CC   contains an N-terminal coiled-coil portion and the C-terminal
CC   globular foldon domain (residues 457-486), which is essential
CC   for fibritin trimerisation and folding [1]. This domain consists
CC   of a beta-hairpin; three such hairpins come together in a
CC   beta-propeller-like arrangement in the trimer, which is
CC   stabilised by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and hydrophobic
CC   interactions [1].
AC   PF07294.5
DE   Fibroin P25
CC   This family consists of several insect fibroin P25 proteins.
CC   Silk fibroin produced by the silkworm Bombyx mori consists of a
CC   heavy chain, a light chain, and a glycoprotein, P25. The heavy
CC   and light chains are linked by a disulfide bond, and P25
CC   associates with disulfide-linked heavy and light chains by
CC   non-covalent interactions. P25 is plays an important role in
CC   maintaining integrity of the complex [1].

DE   Fibrobacter succinogenes major domain (Fib_succ_major)
CC   This domain of about 175 to 200 amino acids is found, in from
CC   one to five copies, in over 50 proteins in Fibrobacter
CC   succinogenes S85, an obligate anaerobe of the rumen. Many
CC   members of this family have an apparent lipoprotein signal
CC   sequence. Conserved cysteine residues, suggestive of disulfide
CC   bond formation, are also consistent with an extracytoplasmic
CC   location for this domain. This domain can also be found in small
CC   numbers of proteins in Chlorobium tepidum and Bacteroides
CC   thetaiotaomicron.
AC   PF02661.12
DE   Fic/DOC family
CC   This family consists of the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP)
CC   protein and doc (death on curing).  The Fic protein is involved
CC   in cell division and is suggested to be involved in the
CC   synthesis of PAB or folate, indicating that the Fic protein and
CC   cAMP are involved in a regulatory mechanism of cell division via
CC   folate metabolism [1].  This family contains a central conserved
CC   motif HPFXXGNG in most members.  The exact molecular function of
CC   these proteins is uncertain.	P1 lysogens of Escherichia coli
CC   carry the prophage as a stable low copy number plasmid. The
CC   frequency with which viable cells cured of prophage are produced
CC   is about 10(-5) per cell per generation [1].	A significant part
CC   of this remarkable stability can be attributed to a
CC   plasmid-encoded mechanism that causes death of cells that have
CC   lost P1 [2]. In other words, the lysogenic cells appear to be
CC   addicted to the presence of the prophage. The plasmid withdrawal
CC   response depends on a gene named doc (death on curing) that is
CC   represented by this family [2]. Doc induces a reversible growth
CC   arrest of E. coli cells by targetting the protein synthesis
CC   machinery. Doc hosts the C-terminal domain of its antitoxin
CC   partner Phd (prevents host death) through fold complementation,
CC   a domain that is intrinsically disordered in solution but that
CC   folds into an alpha-helix on binding to Doc [3].

CC   chromatin distribution, and the liberation of heads by HIV-1
CC   protease liberates may play an important role in HIV-1
CC   associated cytopathogenesis and carcinogenesis [2].

CC   They enable the cell to colonise host epithelia. This family
CC   constitutes the major subunits of CS1 like pili, including CS2
CC   and CFA1 from Escherichia coli, and also the Cable type II pilin
CC   major subunit from Burkholderia cepacia [1]. The major subunit
CC   of CS1 pili is called CooA.  Periplasmic CooA is mostly

AC   PF07554.7
DE   Uncharacterised Sugar-binding Domain
CC   This domain is found in a wide variety of contexts, but mostly
CC   occurring in cell wall associated proteins. A lack of conserved
CC   catalytic residues suggests that it is a binding domain. From
CC   context, possible substrates are hyaluronate or fibronectin
CC   (personal obs: C Yeats). This is further evidenced by [1].
CC   Possibly the exact substrate is N-acetyl glucosamine. Finding it
CC   in the same protein as Pfam:PF05089 further supports this
CC   proposal. It is found in the	C-terminal part of Swiss:O82833,
CC   which is removed during maturation  ([2]). Some of the proteins

DE   Cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase component FixQ
CC   This family consists of several Cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase
CC   components (FixQ/CcoQ). FixQ is found in nitrogen fixing
CC   bacteria. Since nitrogen fixation is an energy-consuming
CC   process, effective symbioses depend on operation of a

DE   Anti-sigma-28 factor, FlgM
CC   FlgM binds and inhibits the activity of the transcription factor
CC   sigma 28. Inhibition of sigma 28 prevents the expression of
CC   genes from flagellar transcriptional class 3, which include
CC   genes for the filament and chemotaxis.  Correctly assembled
CC   basal body-hook structures export FlgM, relieving inhibition of
CC   sigma 28 and allowing expression of class 3 genes. NMR studies
CC   show that free FlgM is mostly unfolded, which may facilitate its
CC   export. The C terminal half of FlgM adopts a tertiary structure
CC   when it binds to sigma 28.  All mutations in FlgM that prevent
CC   sigma 28 inhibition affect the C-terminal domain and is the
CC   region thought to constitute the binding domain. A minimal
CC   binding domain has been identified between Glu 64 and Arg 88 in
CC   Salmonella typhimurium (Swiss:P26477).  The N-terminal portion
CC   remains unstructured and may be necessary for recognition by the

DE   FtsH Extracellular
CC   This domain is found in the FtsH family of proteins. FtsH is the
CC   only membrane-bound ATP-dependent protease universally conserved
CC   in prokaryotes ([1]). It only efficiently degrades proteins that
CC   have a low thermodynamic stability - e.g. it lacks robust

DE   GlnD PII-uridylyltransferase
CC   This is a family of bifunctional uridylyl-removing
CC   enzymes/uridylyltransferases (UR/UTases, GlnD) that are
CC   responsible for the modification (EC:2.7.7.59) of the regulatory
CC   protein P-II, or GlnB (e.g. Swiss:P05826, Pfam:PF00543). In
CC   response to nitrogen limitation, these transferases (e.g.
CC   Swiss:P27249) catalyse the uridylylation of the PII protein,
CC   which in turn stimulates deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase
CC   (GlnA). Deadenylylated glutamine synthetase is the more active
CC   form of the enzyme [1]. Moreover, uridylylated PII can act
CC   together with NtrB and NtrC to increase transcription of genes
CC   in the sigma54 regulon, which include glnA and other
CC   nitrogen-level controlled genes [2]. It has also been suggested
CC   that the product of the glnD gene is involved in other

CC   translational fidelity mechanism replacing incorrectly charged
CC   Glu-tRNAGln with the correct Gln-tRANGln via transmidation of

CC   putative peptidases (see for example Swiss:Q9XIN9). However, the
CC   structure of the protein PDB:3eu8 has an alpha-alpha toroid fold
CC   and is similar to a glucoamylase, PDB:1ayx. Such glucoamylases
CC   are involved in breaking down complex sugars (e.g. starch). The

DE   Glucodextranase, domain B
CC   Members of this family adopt a structure consisting of
CC   seven/eight-strand antiparallel beta-sheets, in a Greek-key
CC   topology, similar to the immunoglobulin beta-sandwich fold. They
CC   act as cell wall anchors, where they interact with the S-layer
CC   present in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria by
CC   hydrophobic interactions. In glucodextranase, Domain B is buried
CC   in the S-layer, and a flexible linker located between domain B
CC   and the catalytic unit confers motion to the catalytic unit,
CC   which is capable of efficient hydrolysis of the substrates
CC   located close to the cell surface [1].

CC   beta-strands are divided into two beta-sheets, and one of the
CC   beta-sheets is wrapped by an extended polypeptide, which appears
CC   to stabilise the domain. Members of this family are mainly

CC   attached to the cell wall peptidoglycan by an amide bond ([1]).
CC   IgA1 protease selectively cleaves human IgA1 and  is likely to
CC   be a pathogenicity factor in some pathogens ([2]). This family

AC   PF10606.3
DE   Homer-binding domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor 
CC   This is the proline-rich region of metabotropic glutamate
CC   receptor proteins that binds Homer-related synaptic proteins.
CC   The Homer proteins form a physical tether linking mGluRs with
CC   the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) that appears to be
CC   due to the proline-rich "Homer ligand" (PPXXFr). Activation of
CC   PI turnover triggers intracellular calcium release [1]. MGluR
CC   function is altered in the mouse model of human Fragile X
CC   syndrome mental retardation, a disorder caused by loss of
CC   function mutations in the Fragile X mental retardation gene
CC   Fmr1. Homer 3 (and to a lesser extent Homer 1b/c) has been shown

DE   Glutaredoxin
AC   PF04399.7
DE   Glutaredoxin 2, C terminal domain
CC   Glutaredoxins are a multifunctional family of
CC   glutathione-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases.  Unlike other
CC   glutaredoxins, glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) cannot reduce
CC   ribonucleotide reductase.  Grx2 has significantly higher
CC   catalytic activity in the reduction of mixed disulphides with
CC   glutathione (GSH) compared with other glutaredoxins. The active
CC   site residues (Cys9-Pro10-Tyr11-Cys12, in Escherichia coli Grx2,
CC   Swiss:P39811), which are found at the interface between the N-
CC   and C-terminal domains are identical to other glutaredoxins, but
CC   there is no other similarity between glutaredoxin 2 and other
CC   glutaredoxins. Grx2 is structurally similar to
CC   glutathione-S-transferases (GST), but there is no obvious
CC   sequence similarity. The inter-domain contacts are mainly
CC   hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains are unlikely to be
CC   stable on their own.	Both domains are needed for correct
CC   folding and activity of Grx2. It is thought that the primary
CC   function of Grx2 is to catalyse reversible glutathionylation of
CC   proteins with GSH in cellular redox regulation including the
CC   response to oxidative stress.
AC   PF03157.7
DE   High molecular weight glutenin subunit
CC   Members of this family include high molecular weight subunits of
CC   glutenin. This group of gluten proteins is thought to be largely
CC   responsible for the elastic properties of gluten, and hence,
CC   doughs. Indeed, glutenin high molecular weight subunits are
CC   classified as elastomeric proteins, because the glutenin network
CC   can withstand significant deformations without breaking, and
CC   return to the original conformation when the stress is removed.
CC   Elastomeric proteins differ considerably in amino acid sequence,
CC   but they are all polymers whose subunits consist of elastomeric
CC   domains, composed of repeated motifs, and non-elastic domains
CC   that mediate cross-linking between the subunits. The elastomeric
CC   domain motifs are all rich in glycine residues in addition to
CC   other hydrophobic residues.  High molecular weight glutenin
CC   subunits have an extensive central elastomeric domain, flanked
CC   by two terminal non-elastic domains that form disulphide
CC   cross-links. The central elastomeric domain is characterised by
CC   the following three repeated motifs: PGQGQQ, GYYPTS[P/L]QQ, GQQ.
CC   It possesses overlapping beta-turns within and between the
CC   repeated motifs, and assumes a regular helical secondary
CC   structure with a diameter of approx. 1.9 nm and a pitch of
CC   approx. 1.5 nm [see 1, fig.2].

CC   blood-born lymphocytes into secondary lymph  nodes. In this
CC   context, sulphatation of the carbohydrates of GlyCAM-1 has  been
CC   shown to be a critical structural requirement to be recognised

DE   N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase component (Gpi1)
CC   Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) represents an important
CC   anchoring  molecule for cell surface proteins.The first step in
CC   its synthesis is the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)
CC   from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to  phosphatidylinositol (PI). This

DE   gpW
CC   gpW is a 68 residue protein known to be present in  phage
CC   particles. Extracts of phage-infected cells lacking gpW contain
CC   DNA-filled heads, and active tails, but no infectious virions.
CC   gpW is required for the addition of gpFII to the head, which is,
CC   in turn, required for the attachment of tails. Since gpFII and
CC   tails are known to be attached at the connector, gpW is also
CC   likely to assemble at this site. The addition of gpW to filled
CC   heads increases the DNase resistance of the packaged DNA,
CC   suggesting that gpW either forms a plug at the connector to
CC   prevent ejection of the DNA, or binds directly to the DNA. The
CC   large number of positively charged residues in gpW (its

DE   Glutamine synthetase type III N terminal 
CC   This domain family is found in bacteria and eukaryotes, and is
CC   approximately 160 amino acids in length. The family is found in
CC   association with Pfam:PF00120. This family is the N terminal
CC   region of glutamine synthetase type III which is one of the
CC   enzymes responsible for generation of glutamine through
CC   conversion glutamate to glutamine by the incorporation of

DE   Glycogen synthase kinase-3 binding
CC   Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) sequentially phosphorylates
CC   four	serine residues on glycogen synthase (GS), in the sequence
CC    SxxxSxxxSxxx-SxxxS(p), by recognising and phosphorylating the
CC   first  serine in the sequence motif SxxxS(P) (where S(p)
CC   represents a	phosphoserine). Interaction of GSK-3 with a
CC   peptide derived from GSK-3 binding protein (this family)
CC   prevents GSK-3 interaction with Axin. This interaction thereby
CC   inhibits the Axin-dependent phosphorylation of  beta-catenin by
CC   GSK-3 [1]. 
AC   PF12019.2
DE   Type II transport protein GspH
CC   GspH is involved in bacterial type II export systems [1]. Like
CC   all pilins, GspH has an N terminus alpha helix [1]. This helix
CC   is followed by nine beta strands forming two beta sheets, one of
CC   five antiparallel strands and one of four antiparallel strands
CC   [1]. GspH is a minor pseudopilin; it is expressed much less than
CC   other pseudopilins in the type II secretion pilus (major pilins)
CC   [1].	The function and localisation of minor pseudo-pilins are
CC   still to be fully unraveled [1]. It has been suggested that some
CC   minor pseudopilins may assemble either into the base or the tip
CC   of pili, or both. They function as initiators or regulators of
CC   pilus biogenesis and dynamics, and/or as adaptors between
CC   various pseudopilin component and other members of the T2SS [1].

DE   GSPII_E N-terminal domain
CC   This domain is found at the N-terminus of members of the general
CC   secretory system II protein E.  Proteins in this subfamily are
CC   typically involved in Type IV pilus biogenesis (eg
CC   Swiss:Q9X4G8), though some are involved in other processes; for
CC   instance aggregation in Myxococcus xanthus ([1]; Swiss:Q9RF11). 
CC   The structure of this domain is now known [2,3].
AC   PF00482.17
DE   Bacterial type II secretion system protein F domain
CC   The original family covered both the regions found by the

CC   Proteins with this domain in form a platform for the type II
CC   secretion machinery, as well as the type IV pili and the
CC   archaeal flagellae [1]. This domain seems to show some
CC   similarity to Pfam:PF00664, but this may just be due to
CC   similarities in the TM helices (personal obs: C Yeats).
AC   PF08334.5
DE   Bacterial type II secretion system protein G
CC   The general secretion pathway, or type II pullulanase-like
CC   machinery, is responsible for the transport of proteins from the
CC   periplasm across the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria
CC   [1,2]. This family includes protein G (e.g. Swiss:P45773,
CC   Swiss:Q00514) involved in this pathway. The PulG protein
CC   (Swiss:P15746) is thought to be anchored in the inner membrane
CC   with its C-terminus directed towards the periplasm [3]. Together
CC   with other members of the secretion machinery, it is thought to
CC   assemble into a pilus-like structure that may function as a
CC   dynamic mechanism to push secreted proteins out of the cell. The
CC   polypeptide is organised into a long N-terminal alpha-helix
CC   followed by a loop region that separates it from a C-terminal

DE   GspL cytoplasmic actin-ATPase-like region
CC   This family consists of general secretion pathway protein L
CC   sequences from several gram-negative bacteria. The general
CC   secretion pathway of gram-negative bacteria is responsible for
CC   extracellular secretion of a number of different proteins,
CC   including proteases and toxins. This pathway supports secretion
CC   of proteins across the cell envelope in two distinct steps, in
CC   which the second step, involving translocation through the outer
CC   membrane, is assisted by at least 13 different gene products.
CC   GspL is predicted to contain a large cytoplasmic domain
CC   represented by this family and has been shown to interact with
CC   the autophosphorylating cytoplasmic membrane protein GspE. It is
CC   thought that the tri-molecular complex of GspL, GspE and GspM
CC   might be involved in regulating the opening and closing of the
CC   secretion pore and/or transducing energy to the site of outer
CC   membrane translocation [1].

CC   synthetases of Trypanosomatidae and Escherichia coli couple
CC   hydrolysis of ATP (to ADP and Pi) with formation of an amide
CC   bond between spermidine and the glycine carboxylate of
CC   glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly). In the pathogenic
CC   trypanosomatids, this reaction is the penultimate step in the
CC   biosynthesis of the antioxidant metabolite, trypanothione
CC   (N1,N8-bis-(glutathionyl)spermidine), and is a target for drug
CC   design [1].

CC   hypothetical archaeal bacterial and C. elegans proteins. HAM1
CC   controls 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) sensitivity and
CC   mutagenesis in S. cerevisiae Swiss:P47119 [1]. The HAM1 protein

DE   Hamartin protein
CC   This family includes the hamartin protein which is thought to
CC   function as a tumour suppressor.  The hamartin protein interacts
CC   with the tuberin protein Pfam:PF03542. Tuberous sclerosis
CC   complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder and is
CC   characterised by the presence of hamartomas in many organs, such
CC   as brain, skin, heart, lung, and kidney. It is caused by
CC   mutation either TSC1 or TSC2 tumour suppressor gene. TSC1
CC   encodes a protein, hamartin, containing two coiled-coil regions,
CC   which have been shown to mediate binding to tuberin. The TSC2
CC   gene codes for tuberin Pfam:PF03542. These two proteins function

DE   Male gamete fusion factor
CC   The gene encoding Arabidopsis HAP2 is allelic with GCS1
CC   (Generative cell-specific protein 1). HAP2 is expressed only in
CC   the haploid sperm and is required for efficient guidance of the
CC   pollen tube to the ovules. In Arabidopsis the protein is a
CC   predicted membrane protein with an N-terminal secretion signal,
CC   a single transmembrane domain and a C-terminal histidine-rich
CC   domain [1]. HAP2-GCS1 is found from plants to lower eukaryotes
CC   and is necessary for the fusion of the gametes in fertilisation.
CC   It is involved in a novel mechanism for gamete fusion where a
CC   first species-specific protein binds male and female gamete
CC   membranes together after which a second, broadly conserved
CC   protein, either directly or indirectly, causes fusion of the two
CC   membranes together. The broadly conserved protein is represented
CC   by this HAP2-GCS1 domain, conserved from plants to lower
CC   eukaryotes [2]. In Plasmodium berghei the protein is expressed
CC   only in male gametocytes and gametes, having a male-specific
CC   function during the interaction with female gametes, and being
CC   indispensable for parasite fertilisation. The gene in plants and
CC   eukaryotes might well have originated from acquisition of

DE   Histone acetylation protein 2
CC   Hap2 is one of three histone acetyltransferases proteins that,

CC   polymerase II (Elongator). The Haps can be isolated in two
CC   forms, as a six-subunit complex with Elongator and as a complex
CC   of the three proteins on their own. The role of the Hap complex
CC   in transcription is still speculative, being possibly to keep
CC   the HAT activity of free Elongator in check, allowing histone
CC   acetylation only in the presence of a transcribing polymerase,
CC   or the interaction with Haps might render Elongator susceptible
CC   to modifications thereby altering its activity [1].

CC   acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyse the transfer of an acetyl
CC   group from acetyl-CoA to the lysine E-amino groups on the
CC   N-terminal tails of histones. HATs are involved in transcription
CC   since histones tend to be hyper-acetylated in actively

CC   This family of class II histone deacetylase complex subunits
CC   HDA2 and HDA3 is found in fungi, The member from S. pombe is
CC   referred to as Ccq1 in Swiss:Q10432. These proteins associate

CC   histone deacetylase complex is responsible for the deacetylation
CC   of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones
CC   (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Histone deacetylation gives a tag for

DE   PBS lyase HEAT-like repeat
CC   This family contains a short bi-helical repeat that is related
CC   to Pfam:PF02985. Cyanobacteria and red algae harvest light
CC   energy using macromolecular complexes known as phycobilisomes
CC   (PBS), peripherally attached to the photosynthetic membrane. The
CC   major components of PBS are the phycobiliproteins. These
CC   heterodimeric proteins are covalently attached to phycobilins:
CC   open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, which function as the
CC   photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. Phycobiliproteins
CC   differ in sequence and in the nature and number of attached
CC   phycobilins to each of their subunits. This family includes the
CC   lyase enzymes that specifically attach particular phycobilins to
CC   apophycobiliprotein subunits. The most comprehensively studied
CC   of these is the CpcE/F lyase Swiss:P31967 Swiss:P31968, which
CC   attaches phycocyanobilin (PCB) to the alpha subunit of
CC   apophycocyanin [1]. Similarly, MpeU/V attaches phycoerythrobilin
CC   to phycoerythrin II, while CpeY/Z is thought to be involved in
CC   phycoerythrobilin (PEB) attachment to phycoerythrin (PE) I (PEs
CC   I and II differ in sequence and in the number of attached
CC   molecules of PEB: PE I has five, PE II has six) [2]. All the
CC   reactions of the above lyases involve an apoprotein cysteine SH
CC   addition to a terminal delta 3,3'-double bond.  Such a reaction
CC   is not possible in the case of phycoviolobilin (PVB), the
CC   phycobilin of alpha-phycoerythrocyanin (alpha-PEC). It is
CC   thought that in this case, PCB, not PVB, is first added to
CC   apo-alpha-PEC, and is then isomerised to PVB. The addition
CC   reaction has been shown to occur in the presence of either of
CC   the components of alpha-PEC-PVB lyase PecE or PecF (or both).
CC   The isomerisation reaction occurs only when both PecE and PecF
CC   components are present, i.e. the PecE/F phycobiliprotein lyase
CC   is also a phycobilin isomerase [3]. Another member of this
CC   family is the NblB protein Swiss:Q9Z3G5, whose similarity to the
CC   phycobiliprotein lyases was previously noted [4].  This
CC   constitutively expressed protein is not known to have any lyase
CC   activity. It is thought to be involved in the coordination of
CC   PBS degradation with environmental nutrient limitation. It has
CC   been suggested that the similarity of NblB to the
CC   phycobiliprotein lyases is due to the ability to bind
CC   tetrapyrrole phycobilins via the common repeated motif [4].

CC   four-disulfide laminin EGFs such as aggrecan and perlecan.  The
CC   core fold of the EGF domain consists of two small beta-hairpins
CC   packed against each other. Two major structural variants have
CC   been identified based on the structural context of the
CC   C-terminal Cys residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal
CC   hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In hEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides
CC   in the beta-turn, resulting in shorter loop-lengths between the
CC   Cys residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[8-9]XC.  These
CC   shorter loop-lengths are also typical of the four-disulfide EGF
CC   domains, laminin ad integrin.  Tandem hEGF domains have six

AC   PF03121.9
DE   Herpesviridae UL52/UL70 DNA primase
CC   Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA replication in host cells is
CC   known to be mediated by seven viral-encoded proteins, three of
CC   which form a heterotrimeric DNA helicase-primase complex. This
CC   complex consists of UL5, UL8, and UL52 subunits.  Heterodimers
CC   consisting of UL5 and UL52 have been shown to retain both
CC   helicase and primase activities. Nevertheless, UL8 is still
CC   essential for replication: though it lacks any DNA binding or
CC   catalytic activities, it is involved in the transport of
CC   UL5-UL52 and it also interacts with other replication proteins.
CC   The molecular mechanisms of the UL5-UL52 catalytic activities
CC   are not known. While UL5 is associated with DNA helicase
CC   activity and UL52 with DNA primase activity, the helicase
CC   activity requires the interaction of UL5 and UL52 [see 2,3]. It
CC   is not known if the primase activity can be maintained by UL52
CC   alone. The region encompassed by residues 610-636 of HSV1 UL52
CC   Swiss:P10236 is thought to contain a divalent metal cation
CC   binding motif. Indeed, this region contains several aspartate
CC   and  glutamate residues that might be involved in divalent
CC   cation binding. The biological significance of UL52-UL8
CC   interaction is not known. Yeast two-hybrid analysis together
CC   with immunoprecipitation experiments	have shown that the HSV1
CC   UL52 region between residues 366-914 is essential for this
CC   interaction, while the first 349 N-terminal residues are
CC   dispensable [2].  This family also includes protein UL70 from
CC   cytomegalovirus (CMV, a subgroup of the Herpesviridae) strains
CC   (e.g. Swiss:P17149), which, by analogy with UL52, is thought to
CC   have DNA primase activity. Indeed, CMV  strains also possess a
CC   DNA helicase-primase complex, the other subunits  being protein
CC   UL105 (with known similarity to HSV1 UL5) and protein UL102.

DE   Herpesvirus UL55 protein
CC   In infected cells, UL55 is associated with the nuclear matrix,
CC   and found adjacent to compartments containing the capsid protein

CC   thought that UL55 may play a role in virion assembly or
CC   maturation [1].
AC   PF04534.6
DE   Herpesvirus UL56 protein
CC   In herpes simplex virus type 2, UL56 is thought to be a
CC   tail-anchored type II membrane protein involved in vesicular

AC   PF05784.5
DE   Betaherpesvirus UL82/83 protein N terminus
CC   This family represents the N terminal region of the
CC   Betaherpesvirus UL82 and UL83 proteins. As viruses are reliant
CC   upon their host cell to serve as proper environments for their
CC   replication, many have evolved mechanisms to alter intracellular
CC   conditions to suit their own needs. Human cytomegalovirus
CC   induces quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle and then arrests
CC   them in late G(1), before they enter the S phase, a cell cycle
CC   compartment that is presumably favourable for viral replication.
CC   The protein product of the human cytomegalovirus UL82 gene,
CC   pp71, can accelerate the movement of cells through the G(1)
CC   phase of the cell cycle. This activity would help infected cells
CC   reach the late G(1) arrest point sooner and thus may stimulate
CC   the infectious cycle. pp71 also induces DNA synthesis in
CC   quiescent cells, but a pp71 mutant protein that is unable to
CC   induce quiescent cells to enter the cell cycle still retains the
CC   ability to accelerate the G(1) phase. Thus, the mechanism
CC   through which pp71 accelerates G(1) cell cycle progression
CC   appears to be distinct from the one that it employs to induce
CC   quiescent cells to exit G(0) and subsequently enter the S phase
CC   [1].

CC   domains, such as a nuclease of the restriction endonuclease fold
CC   and TDP1-like DNA phosphoesterases, in the eukaryotes [1]. It

AC   PF09453.4
DE   HIRA B motif
CC   The HirA B (Histone regulatory homologue A binding) motif is the
CC   essential binding interface between HIRA Pfam:PF07569 and ASF1a,
CC   of approx. 40 residues. It forms an antiparallel beta-hairpin
CC   that binds perpendicular to the strands of the beta-sandwich of
CC   ASF1a N-terminal core domain, via beta-sheet, salt bridge and
CC   van der Waals interactions [1]. The two histone chaperone
CC   proteins, HIRA and ASF1a, form a heterodimer with histones H3
CC   and H4. HIRA is the human orthologue of Hir proteins known to
CC   silence histone gene expression and create transcriptionally
CC   silent heterochromatin in yeast, flies, plants and humans. The
CC   yeast CAF1B proteins which bind H3 also carry this motif at
CC   their very C-terminus.

DE   Histidine-rich Calcium-binding repeat region
CC   This is a histidine-rich calcium binding repeat which appears in
CC   proteins called histidine-rich-calcium binding proteins (HRC).
CC   HRC is a high capacity, low affinity Ca2+-binding protein,
CC   residing in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. HRC binds
CC   directly to triadin. This binding interaction occurs between the
CC   histidine-rich region of HRC and multiple clusters of charged
CC   amino acids, named as the KEKE motifs, in the lumenal domain of
CC   triadin. The region in which this repeat is found in many copies
CC   is long and variable but is the acidic region of the protein.
CC   There is also a cysteine-rich region further towards the
CC   C-terminus [1]. HRC may regulate sarcoplasmic reticular calcium
CC   transport and play a critical role in maintaining calcium
CC   homeostasis and function in the heart. HRC as a candidate

CC   Proteins involved in steps 4 and 6 of the histidine biosynthesis
CC   pathway are contained in this family. Histidine is formed by
CC   several complex and distinct biochemical reactions catalysed by
CC   eight enzymes.  The enzymes in this Pfam entry are called His6
CC   and His7 in eukaryotes and HisA and HisF in prokaryotes. The
CC   structure of HisA is known to be a TIM barrel fold.  In some
CC   archaeal HisA proteins the TIM barrel is composed of two tandem
CC   repeats of a half barrel e.g. Swiss:P05325 [3]. This family
CC   belong to the common phosphate binding site TIM barrel family

AC   PF08047.5
DE   Histidine operon leader peptide
CC   This family consists of the leader peptide of  the histidine
CC   (his) operon. The his operon contains  all the genes necessary
CC   for histidine biosynthesis.  The region corresponding to the
CC   untranslated 5' end  of the transcript, named the his leader
CC   region, displays  the typical features of the T box
CC   transcriptional  attenuation mechanism which is involved in the

DE   Histidine phosphatase superfamily (branch 1)
CC   The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because
CC   catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently
CC   phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle.  Other conserved
CC   residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with
CC   the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its
CC   transfer to the His residue.	  Structure and sequence analyses
CC   show that different families contribute different additional
CC   residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly,
CC   differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of
CC   a catalytically essential acidic residue.  The superfamily may
CC   be divided into two main branches.  The larger branch 1 contains
CC   a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being
CC   fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein
CC   with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent
CC   phosphoglycerate mutase.  The latter is an unusual example of a
CC   mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members
CC   appear to be phosphatases.  The bacterial regulatory protein
CC   phosphatase SixA is also in branch 1 and has a minimal, and
CC   possible ancestral-like structure, lacking the large domain
CC   insertions that contribute to binding of small molecules in
CC   branch 1 members.

CC   predominantly eukaryotic proteins.  The catalytic functions in
CC   members include phytase, glucose-1-phosphatase and multiple
CC   inositol polyphosphate phosphatase.  The in vivo roles of the
CC   mammalian acid phosphatases in branch 2 are not fully

CC   converting them to the active toxin. Acyl-acyl carrier protein
CC   (ACP) is the essential acyl donor.  This family show a number of

CC   This family consists of several enterobacterial haemolysin
CC   (HlyE) proteins.Hemolysin E (HlyE) is a novel pore-forming toxin
CC   of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Shigella flexneri.
CC   HlyE is unrelated to the well characterised pore-forming E. coli
CC   hemolysins of the RTX family, haemolysin A (HlyA), and the

CC   coli 0157. However, it is evident that expression of HlyE in the
CC   absence of the RTX toxins is sufficient to give a hemolytic
CC   phenotype in E. coli. HlyE is a protein of 34 kDa that is
CC   expressed during anaerobic growth of E. coli. Anaerobic
CC   expression is controlled by the transcription factor, FNR, such
CC   that, upon ingestion and entry into the anaerobic mammalian

DE   HOOK protein
CC   This family consists of several HOOK1, 2 and 3 proteins from

CC   HsbA adsorbed to hydrophobic PBSA (Polybutylene
CC   succinate-co-adipate) surfaces in the presence of NaCl or CaCl2.
CC   When HsbA was adsorbed on the hydrophobic PBSA surfaces, it
CC   promoted PBSA degradation via the CutL1 polyesterase. CutL1
CC   interacts directly with HsbA attached to the hydrophobic QCM

DE   Mu DNA binding, I gamma subdomain
CC   Members of this family are responsible for binding the DNA
CC   attachment sites at each end of the Mu genome. They adopt a
CC   secondary structure comprising a four helix bundle tightly
CC   packed around a hydrophobic core consisting of aliphatic and
CC   aromatic amino acid residues. Helices 1 and 2 are oriented
CC   antiparallel to each other. Helix 3 crosses helices 1 and 2 at
CC   angles of 60 and 120 degrees, respectively. Excluding the
CC   C-terminal helix 4, the fold of the I-gamma subdomain is
CC   remarkably similar to that of the homeodomain family of

DE   Tc3 transposase
CC   Tc3 is transposase with a specific DNA-binding domain which
CC   contains three alpha-helices, two of which form a
CC   helix-turn-helix motif which makes four base-specific contacts
CC   with the major groove. The N-terminus makes contacts with the
CC   minor groove. There is a base specific recognition between Tc3
CC   and the transposon DNA. The DNA binding domain forms a dimer in
CC   which each monomer binds a separate transposon end. This
CC   implicates that the dimer has a role in synapsis and is
CC   necessary for the simultaneous cleavage of both transposon
CC   termini [1].

CC   the well characterised repressor protein HutC. Genetic analysis
CC   using transcriptional fusions (lacZ) and deletion mutants shows
CC   that hutD is necessary to maintain fitness in environments
CC   replete with histidine. Evidence outlined by Zhang & Rainey
CC   (2007) suggests that HutD functions as a governor that sets an
CC   upper bound on the level of hut operon transcription [1]. The
CC   mechanistic basis is unknown, but in silico molecular docking
CC   studies based on the crystal structure of PA5104 (HutD from

DE   Hyaluronidase protein (HylP)
CC   This family consists of several phage associated hyaluronidase
CC   proteins (EC:3.2.1.35) which seem to be specific to
CC   Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pyogenes
CC   bacteriophages. The substrate of hyaluronidase is hyaluronic
CC   acid, a sugar polymer composed of alternating

CC   acid is found in the ground substance of human connective tissue
CC   and the vitreous of the eye and also is the sole component of
CC   the capsule of group A streptococci. The capsule has been shown
CC   to be an important virulence factor of this organism by virtue

CC   This family is conserved in Proteobacteria. It is likely to be
CC   the transcriptional repressor molecule for the hyc and hyp
CC   operons, which express, amongst others, the protein HycA. This
CC   protein may be harnessed for the reduction of technetium oxide,

DE   Mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, IATP
CC   ATP synthase inhibitor prevents the enzyme from switching to ATP
CC   hydrolysis during collapse of the electrochemical gradient, for

CC   forms a one to one complex with the F1 ATPase, possibly by

CC   dimer (the active state) and tetramer. At low pH , the inhibitor
CC   forms a dimer via antiparallel coiled coil interactions between

CC   domain, IBD, connected via a flexible, proteolytically
CC   sensitive, linker (residues 127-145) to a C-terminal domain. The
CC   IBD structure reveals a winged-helix-wing conformation with each
CC   element binding to DNA, the central helix-turn-helix
CC   contributing the majority of the specificity-determining

DE   Beta-1 integrin binding protein
CC   ICAP-1 is a serine/threonine-rich protein that binds to the
CC   cytoplasmic domains of beta-1 integrins in a highly specific

CC   The cytoplasmic domains of integrins are essential for cell
CC   adhesion, and the fact that phosphorylation of ICAP-1 by

CC   Overexpression of ICAP-1 strongly reduces the integrin-mediated
CC   cell spreading on extracellular matrix and inhibits both Cdc42
CC   and Rac1. In addition, ICAP-1 induces release of Cdc42 from

DE   Translation-initiation factor 2
CC   IF-2 is a translation initiator in each of the three main
CC   phylogenetic domains (Eukaryotes [1], Bacteria [2] and Archaea
CC   [3]). IF2 interacts with formylmethionine-tRNA, GTP, IF1, IF3

CC   gamma receptor has been shown to be secreted from infected cells

CC   homologous to the E. coli YrfF and P. mirabilis UmoB proteins.
CC   Whereas the biological function of YrfF is currently unknown,
CC   UmoB has been shown elsewhere to act as a positive regulator of

CC   been shown to repress cell division during P. mirabilis
CC   swarming, suggesting that UmoB could repress cell division via

CC   [1]. This domain contains two disulfide bridges, one of which

AC   PF11555.2
DE   EGFR receptor inhibitor Mig-6
CC   When the kinase domain of EGFR binds to segment one of Mitogen
CC   induced gene 6 (Mig-6), EGFR becomes inactive due to the
CC   conformation it adopts which is Src/CDK like. The binding of the
CC   two proteins prevents EGFR acting as a cyclin-like activator for
CC   other kinase domains [1].The structure of Mig-6(1) consists of
CC   alpha helices-G and -H with a polar surface and hydrophobic
CC   residues for interactions with EGFR. A critical step for the
CC   activation of EGFR is the formation of an asymmetric dimer
CC   involving the kinase domains of the protein. Since Mig-6 binds
CC   to the kinase domain it blocks this process and EGFR becomes
CC   inactive [1].

CC   This enzyme (EC:2.4.2.-) modifies exclusively the initiator tRNA
CC   in position 64 using 5'-phosphoribosyl-1'-pyrophosphate as the

DE   Insect allergen related repeat, nitrile-specifier detoxification
CC   This family exemplifies a case of novel gene evolution. The case
CC   in point is the arms-race between plants and their infective
CC   insective herbivores in the area of the glucosinolate-myrosinase
CC   system. Brassicas have developed the glucosinolate-myrosinase
CC   system as chemical defence mechanism against the insects, and
CC   consequently the insects have adapted to produce a detoxifying
CC   molecule, nitrile-specifier protein (NSP). NSP is present in the
CC   small white butterfly Pieris rapae. NSP is structurally
CC   different from and has no amino acid homology to any known
CC   detoxifying enzymes, and it appears to have arisen by a process
CC   of domain and gene duplication of a sequence of unknown function
CC   that is widespread in insect species and referred to as

CC   domain, whose sequence is highly conserved. It is described as
CC   consisting of three regions. The N-terminal region is thought to
CC   bind the lipid and contains two helices and an eight-stranded,
CC   mostly antiparallel beta-sheet. An intervening loop region,
CC   which is thought to play a role in protein-protein interactions,
CC   separates this from the C-terminal region, which exhibits the
CC   greatest sequence variation and may be involved in membrane
CC   binding. PITP alpha (Swiss:Q00169) has a 16-fold greater
CC   affinity for PI than PC. Together with PITP beta (Swiss:P48739),
CC   it is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues [1].

CC   (double-stranded RNA-activated factor 1).	 Viral dsRNA
CC   produced during viral transcription or replication leads to the
CC   activation of DRAF1. The DNA-binding specificity of DRAF1
CC   correlates with transcriptional induction of ISG
CC   (interferon-alpha,beta-stimulated gene). IRF-3 preexists in the
CC   cytoplasm of uninfected cells and translocates to the nucleus
CC   following viral infection. Translocation of IRF-3 is accompanied

CC   ESCRT-I, -II, and -III are endosomal sorting complexes required
CC   for transporting proteins and carry out cargo sorting and
CC   vesicle formation in the multivesicular bodies, MVBs, pathway.
CC   These complexes are transiently recruited from the cytoplasm to

CC   previously marked for degradation by mono-ubiquitination.
CC   Assembly of ESCRT-III, a complex composed of at least four

DE   Haemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP)
CC   This family consists of several insect-specific haemolymph
CC   juvenile hormone binding proteins (JHBP). Juvenile hormone
CC   regulates embryogenesis, maintains the status quo of larval
CC   development and stimulates reproductive maturation in the adult
CC   insect. JH is transported from the sites of its synthesis to
CC   target tissues by a haemolymph carrier called juvenile
CC   hormone-binding protein (JHBP). JHBP protects the JH molecules
CC   from hydrolysis by non-specific esterases present in the insect
CC   haemolymph [1]. The crystal structure of the JHBP from Galleria
CC   mellonella shows an unusual fold consisting of a long
CC   alpha-helix wrapped in a much curved antiparallel beta-sheet.
CC   The folding pattern for this structure closely resembles that
CC   found in some tandem-repeat mammalian lipid-binding and
CC   bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, with a similar
CC   organisation of the major cavity and a disulfide bond linking
CC   the long helix and the beta-sheet. It would appear that JHBP
CC   forms two cavities, only one of which, the one near the N- and
CC   C-termini, binds the hormone; binding induces a conformational
CC   change, of unknown significance [1]. This family now includes

CC   translocation that comprises amplified chromosomal segments
CC   jumping to various telomeres. JTB, located at 1q21, has been
CC   found to fuse with the telomeric repeats of acceptor telomeres
CC   in a case of JT. hJTB (human JTB) encodes a trans-membrane
CC   protein that is highly conserved among divergent eukaryotic

CC   produces an hJTB product devoid of the trans-membrane domain.

CC   range in bacteria and in animals. Many of the prokaryotic KAP
CC   NTPases are encoded in plasmids and tend to undergo disruption
CC   to form pseudogenes. A unique feature of all eukaryotic and

DE   Nuclear envelope localisation domain
CC   The KASH (for Klarsicht/ANC-1/Syne-1 homology) or KLS domain is
CC   a highly hydrophobic nuclear envelope localisation domain of
CC   approximately 60 amino acids comprising a 20-amino-acid
CC   transmembrane region and a 30-35-residue C-terminal region that
CC   lies between the inner and the outer nuclear membranes [1].
CC   During meiotic prophase, telomeres cluster to form a bouquet
CC   arrangement of chromosomes.  Studies in pombe have revealed that
CC   bouquet formation involves interaction between a SUN domain
CC   protein, Sad1, and a putative KASH domain protein, Kms1. SUN and
CC   KASH domain proteins form complexes that span both membranes of
CC   the nuclear envelope. The KASH domain links the dynein motor
CC   complex of the microtubules, through the outer nuclear membrane
CC   to the Sad1 domain in the inner nuclear membrane which then
CC   interacts with the bouquet proteins Bqt1 and Bqt2 that are
CC   complexed with Bqt4, Rap1 and Taz1 and attached to the telomere
CC   [2]. SUN domain-containing proteins are essential for recruiting
CC   KASH domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane, and KASH
CC   domains provide a generic NE tethering device for functionally
CC   distinct proteins whose cytoplasmic domains mediate nuclear
CC   positioning, maintain physical connections with other cellular
CC   organelles, and possibly even influence chromosome dynamics [3].

CC   KAT11 results in the loss of H3K56 acetylation, both on bulk
CC   histone and on chromatin [1]. KAT11 and H3K56 acetylation appear
CC   to correlate with actively transcribed genes and associate with

DE   Ankyrin-G binding motif of KCNQ2-3
CC   Interactions with ankyrin-G are crucial to the localisation of
CC   voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at the axon initial
CC   segment and for neurons to initiate action potentials. This
CC   conserved 9-amino acid motif ((V/A)P(I/L)AXXE(S/D)D) is required
CC   for ankyrin-G binding and functions to localise sodium channels
CC   to a variety of 'excitable' membrane domains both inside and
CC   outside of the nervous system [1]. This motif has also been
CC   identified in the potassium channel 6TM proteins KCNQ2 and KCNQ3
CC   [2], that correspond to the M channels that exert a crucial
CC   influence over neuronal excitability. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels are
CC   preferentially localised to the surface of axons both at the
CC   axonal initial segment and more distally, and this axonal
CC   initial segment targeting of surface KCNQ channels is mediated
CC   by these ankyrin-G binding motifs of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 [3]. KCNQ3
CC   is a major determinant of M channel localisation to the AIS,

CC   during the differentiation of hair matrix cells, and form hair
CC   fibres in association with hair keratin intermediate filaments
CC   [1]. This family has been divided up into four regions, with the

CC   products of mammalian epidermal derivatives such as wool and
CC   hair consist of microfibrils embedded in a rigid matrix of other
CC   proteins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulphur and
CC   high-tyrosine keratins, having molecular weights of 6-20 kDa,
CC   whereas microfibrils contain the larger, low-sulphur keratins
CC   (40-56 kDa) [1].

CC   The structure of beta-ketoacyl synthase is similar to that of
CC   the  thiolase family (Pfam:PF00108) and also chalcone synthase.
CC   The active site of beta-ketoacyl synthase is located between the

DE   Plasmid replication region DNA-binding N-term
CC   The broad host-range plasmid RK2 is able to replicate in and be
CC   inherited in a stable manner in diverse Gram-negative bacterial
CC   species. It encodes a number of co-ordinately regulated operons
CC   including a central control korF1 operon that represses the kfrA
CC   operon. The KfrA polypeptide is a site-specific DNA-binding
CC   protein whose operator overlaps the kfrA promoter. The
CC   N-terminus, containing an helix-turn-helix motif, is essential
CC   for function. Downstream from this family is an extended
CC   coiled-coil domain containing a heptad repeat segment which is
CC   probably responsible for formation of multimers, and may provide

CC   partitioning [2].
AC   PF10685.3
DE   Stress-induced bacterial acidophilic repeat motif
CC   This repeat is found in proteins which are expressed under
CC   conditions of stress in bacteria. The repeat contains a highly
CC   conserved, characteristic sequence motif,KGG, that is also
CC   recognised by plants and lower eukaryotes and repeated in their
CC   LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) family of proteins, thereby
CC   rendering those proteins bacteriostatic. An example of such an
CC   LEA family is LEA_5, Pfam:PF00477. Further downstream from this
CC   motif is a Walker A, nucleotide binding, motif GXXXXGK(S,T),
CC   that in YciG of E coli, eg Swiss:Q8X7B4, is QSGGNKSGKS [URL].
CC   YciG is expressed as part of a three-gene operon, yciGFE, and
CC   this operon is induced by stress and is regulated by RpoS, which
CC   controls the general stress-response in E coli. YciG was shown
CC   to be important for stationary-phase resistance to thermal
CC   stress and in particular to acid stress.

CC   The kicA and kicB genes are found upstream of mukB. It has been
CC   suggested that the kicB gene encodes a killing factor and the
CC   kicA gene codes for a protein that suppresses the killing
CC   function of the kicB gene product [1]. It was also demonstrated
CC   that KicA and KicB can function as a post-segregational killing
CC   system, when the genes are transferred from the E. coli
CC   chromosome onto a plasmid [1].

CC   suggested to play an important genus-wide role in the biology of
CC   the Borrelia [1].

CC   found in a wide range of proteins of large bacterial and
CC   eukaryotic DNA viruses. The KilA-N domain family also includes
CC   the previously defined APSES domain. The KilA-N and APSES
CC   domains may also share a common fold with the nucleic
CC   acid-binding modules of the LAGLIDADG nucleases and the

DE   Kinesin-related
CC   This family represents a region within kinesin-related proteins
CC   from higher plants. Many family members also contain the
CC   Pfam:PF00225 domain. Kinesins are ATP-driven microtubule motor
CC   proteins that produce directed force [1]. Some family members
CC   are associated with the phragmoplast, a structure composed
CC   mainly of microtubules that executes cytokinesis in higher

DE   Central kinetochore-associated
CC   This is a family of proteins integrally involved in the central
CC   kinetochore. In baker's yeast the protein seems to be part of a
CC   macromolecular kinetochore complex and appears to contribute to
CC   the proper associations among the central kinetochore
CC   sub-complexes and the kinetochore-specific nucleosome.  The
CC   family is localised in such a way as to bridge the COMA and
CC   Ndc80 complexes onto the centromeric nucleosome [1]. The family
CC   also contains plant proteins ALF4 and the human glomulin. This
CC   family also contains human FKBP-12, also known as FAP68 or
CC   FK506-binding protein, expressed at high levels in skeletal
CC   muscle, heart, brain and kidney and is a cytoplasmic protein,
CC   specifically bound by the non-phosphorylated form of the
CC   hepatocyte growth factor, HGF, receptor and is released upon HGF
CC   stimulation and receptor phosphorylation, suggesting a potential
CC   role for FKBP12 in linking HGF signaling to the regulation of
CC   protein synthesis [2]. FKBP12 is found to regulate Ca2+ release
CC   from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by its action on the IP3
CC   receptors (IP3Rs), which crucially regulate diverse cell
CC   signalling processes from reproduction to apoptosis, possibly
CC   via the kinase rapamycin (mTOR), that potentiates Ca2+ release
CC   from the IP3R in smooth muscle [3].

DE   Central kinetochore-associated
CC   This is a family of proteins integrally involved in the central
CC   kinetochore. Slk19 is a yeast member and it may play an
CC   important role in the timing of nuclear migration. It may also
CC   participate, directly or indirectly, in the maintenance of
CC   centromeric tensile strength during mitotic stagnation, for
CC   instance during activation of checkpoint controls, when cells
CC   need to preserve nuclear integrity until cell cycle progression
CC   can be resumed [1].
AC   PF08260.5
DE   Insect kinin peptide
CC   These neuropeptides are the first members of the insect
CC   kinin-family isolated from the American cockroach. Their
CC   occurrence in the retrocerebral complex suggests a physiological
CC   role as a neurohormone. The C-terminal sequence
CC   Phe-X-Ser-Trp-Gly-NH2 characterised the peptides as members of
CC   the insect kinin family.  Data suggest a possible involvement of
CC   insect kinins in water-balance by regulating the osmoregulation.

CC   are similar to kinase interacting protein 1 (KIP1), which has
CC   been found to interact with the kinase domain of PRK1, a
CC   receptor-like  kinase [1]. This particular region contains two 
CC   coiled-coils, which are described as motifs involved in
CC   protein-protein interactions [1]. It has also been suggested
CC   that the protein's coiled- coils allow it to dimerise in vivo
CC   [1].
AC   PF02172.10
DE   KIX domain

CC   subunit being composed of two domains.  The C-terminal domain
CC   contains five alpha helices, four of which are organised into an

CC   carcinoma, while the other members were found by homology
CC   search. The family is involved in the regulation of actin

DE   Keratin-associated matrix
CC   The major structural proteins of mammalian hair are the hair
CC   keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) and the keratin-associated

CC   embedded in an inter-filamentous matrix consisting of KRTAPs
CC   which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant
CC   hair shaft as a result of disulfide bonds between cysteine
CC   residues. There are essentially three groups of KRTAPs, viz: the
CC   high-sulfur (HS) and ultra-high-sulfur (UHS) KRTAPs (cysteine

CC   This domain is part of the transcript of the fusion of two

CC   localise to cytoplasmic structures, indicating that the addition
CC   of a Kua domain to UEV confers new biological properties.
CC   UEV1-Kua carries the B domain with its characteristic double
CC   histidine motif, and it is probably this domain which determines
CC   the cytoplasmic localisation. It is postulated that this hybrid
CC   transcript could preferentially direct the variant

DE   Potassium channel Kv1.4 tandem inactivation domain
CC   This family features the tandem inactivation domain found at the
CC   N-terminus of the Kv1.4 potassium channel. It is composed of two
CC   subdomains. Inactivation domain 1 (ID1, residues 1-38) consists
CC   of a flexible N-terminus anchored at a 5-turn helix, and is
CC   thought to work by occluding the ion pathway, as is the case
CC   with a classical ball domain. Inactivation domain 2 (ID2,
CC   residues 40-50) is a 2.5 turn helix with a high proportion of
CC   hydrophobic residues that probably serves to attach ID1 to the
CC   cytoplasmic face of the channel. In this way, it can promote
CC   rapid access of ID1 to the receptor site in the open channel.
CC   ID1 and ID2 function together to being about fast inactivation
CC   of the Kv1.4 channel, which is important for the channel's role

CC   The L27_2 domain is a protein-protein interaction domain capable
CC   of organising scaffold proteins into supramolecular assemblies
CC   by formation of heteromeric L27_2 domain complexes. L27_2
CC   domain-mediated protein assemblies have been shown to play
CC   essential roles in cellular processes including asymmetric cell
CC   division, establishment and maintenance of cell polarity, and
CC   clustering of receptors and ion channels. Members of this family
CC   form specific heterotetrameric complexes, in which each domain
CC   contains three alpha-helices. The two N-terminal helices of each
CC   L27_2 domain pack together to form a tight, four-helix bundle in
CC   the heterodimer, whilst the third helix of each L27_2 domain
CC   forms another four-helix bundle that assembles the two units of

DE   Late embryogenesis abundant protein 18
CC   This is a family of late embryogenesis-abundant proteins There
CC   is high accumulation of this protein in dry seeds, and in the
CC   roots of full-grown plants in response to dehydration and ABA
CC   (abscisic acid application) treatments [1]. This LEA protein
CC   disappears after germination. It accumulates in growing regions
CC   of well irrigated hypocotyls and meristems suggesting a role in
CC   seedling growth resumption on rehydration [2]. As a group the
CC   LEA proteins are highly hydrophilic, contain a high percentage
CC   of glycine residues, lack Cys and Trp residues and do not
CC   coagulate upon exposure to high temperature, and for these
CC   reasons are considered to be members of a group of proteins

CC   recognised members of a family of animal lectins similar
CC   (19-24%) to the leguminous plant lectins [1]. The alignment for
CC   this family aligns residues lying towards the N-terminus, where

DE   Bacterial lipoate protein ligase C-terminus
CC   This is the C-terminal domain of a bacterial lipoate protein
CC   ligase. There is no conservation between this C-terminus and
CC   that of vertebrate lipoate protein ligase C-termini, but both
CC   are associated with the domain BPL_LipA_LipB Pfam:PF03099,

CC   has a role in recognising the lipoyl domain and/or transferring
CC   the lipoyl group onto it from the lipoyl-AMP intermediate.
CC   C-terminal fragments of length 172 to 193 amino acid residues

CC   LuxE is an acyl-protein synthetase found in bioluminescent
CC   bacteria.  LuxE catalyses the formation of an acyl-protein
CC   thioester from a fatty acid and a protein.		  This is

CC   system, which converts tetradecanoic acid to the aldehyde
CC   substrate of the luciferase-catalysed bioluminescence reaction
CC   [1] A conserved cysteine found at position 364 in Photobacterium
CC   phosphoreum LuxE (Swiss:Q52100) is thought to be acylated during

DE   C-terminal domain of homeodomain 1
CC   Mating in fungi is controlled by the loci that determine the

CC   evolved a unique mating system, termed tetrapolar or bifactorial
CC   incompatibility, in which mating type is determined by two
CC   unlinked loci; compatibility at both loci is required for mating
CC   to occur. The multi-allelic tetrapolar mating system is

DE   Organiser of macrodomain of Terminus of chromosome
CC   This family, many of whose members are YcbG, organises the
CC   macrodomain Ter of the chromosome of bacteria such as E coli. In
CC   these bacteria, insulated macrodomains influence the segregation
CC   of sister chromatids and the mobility of chromosomal DNA.
CC   Organisation of the Terminus region (Ter) into a macrodomain
CC   relies on the presence of a 13 bp motif called matS repeated 23
CC   times in the 800-kb-long domain. MatS sites are the main targets
CC   in the E. coli chromosome of YcbG or MatP (macrodomain Ter
CC   protein). MatP accumulates in the cell as a discrete focus that
CC   co-localises with the Ter macrodomain. The effects of MatP
CC   inactivation reveal its role as the main organiser of the Ter
CC   macrodomain: in the absence of MatP, DNA is less compacted, the
CC   mobility of markers is increased, and segregation of the Ter
CC   macrodomain occurs early in the cell cycle. A specific
CC   organisational system is required in the Terminus region for
CC   bacterial chromosome management during the cell cycle.

CC   specifically involved in the processing, transport, and/or

DE   MBA1-like protein
CC   Mba1 is an inner membrane protein that is part of the

CC   C-terminal ribosome-binding domain of Oxa1, which is a central
CC   component of the insertion machinery of the inner membrane. In
CC   the absence of both Mba1 and the C-terminus of Oxa1,
CC   mitochondrial translation products fail to be properly inserted
CC   into the inner membrane and serve as substrates of the matrix
CC   chaperone Hsp70 [3].	It is proposed that Mba1 functions as a

DE   Meiotic cell cortex C-terminal pleckstrin homology
CC   The PH domain of these largely fungal proteins is necessary for
CC   the cortical localisation of the protein during meiosis, since
CC   the overall function of the protein is to anchor dynein at the

DE   Cobalamin-independent synthase, Catalytic domain
CC   This is a family of vitamin-B12 independent methionine synthases
CC   or 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate--homocysteine
CC   methyltransferases, EC:2.1.1.14 from bacteria and plants. Plants
CC   are the only higher eukaryotes that have the required enzymes
CC   for methionine synthesis [1]. This enzyme catalyses the last
CC   step in the production of methionine by transferring a methyl
CC   group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine [1]. The
CC   aligned region makes up the carboxy region of the approximately
CC   750 amino acid protein except in some hypothetical archaeal

DE   Methionine biosynthesis protein MetW
CC   This family consists of several bacterial and one archaeal
CC   methionine biosynthesis MetW proteins. Biosynthesis of
CC   methionine from homoserine in Pseudomonas putida takes place in
CC   three steps. The first step is the acylation of homoserine to
CC   yield an acyl-L-homoserine. This reaction is catalysed by the
CC   products of the metXW genes and is equivalent to the first step
CC   in enterobacteria, gram-positive bacteria and fungi, except that
CC   in these microorganisms the reaction is catalysed by a single
CC   polypeptide (the product of the metA gene in Escherichia coli
CC   and the met5 gene product in Neurospora crassa). In Pseudomonas
CC   putida, as in gram-positive bacteria and certain fungi, the
CC   second and third steps are a direct sulfhydrylation that
CC   converts the O-acyl-L-homoserine into homocysteine and further
CC   methylation to yield methionine. The latter reaction can be
CC   mediated by either of the two methionine synthetases present in
CC   the cells [1].

DE   Fimbrillin-A associated anchor proteins Mfa1 and Mfa2
CC   This family of proteins may be lipoproteins principally from
CC   bacilli.  They are between 300 and 400 residues. Many
CC   Bacteroides-like bacterial species, including Porphyromonas
CC   gingivalis, the causal agent of periodontal infection, carry at
CC   least two types of fimbriae, namely FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae,
CC   following the names of their major subunit proteins [1].
CC   Normally, FimA fimbriae are long filaments that are easily
CC   detached from cells, whereas Mfa1 fimbriae are short filaments
CC   that are tightly bound to cells; however, in the absence of Mfa2
CC   protein, the Mfa1 fimbriae are also very long and are not
CC   attached. Mfa2 and Mfa1 are associated with each other in whole
CC   P. gingivalis cells to the extent that Mfa2 is located on the
CC   cell surface and probably associated with Mfa1 fimbriae in such
CC   a way that it anchors the Mfa1 fimbriae to the cell surface and

DE   MgsA AAA+ ATPase C terminal
CC   The MgsA protein possesses DNA-dependent ATPase and ssDNA

DE   MH1 domain
CC   The MH1 (MAD homology 1) domain is found at the amino terminus
CC   of MAD related proteins such as Smads. This domain is separated
CC   from the MH2 domain by a non-conserved linker region. The
CC   crystal structure of the MH1 domain shows that a highly

CC   consensus sequence GNCN in the major groove, shown to be vital
CC   for the transcriptional activation of target genes. Not all
CC   examples of MH1 can bind to DNA however.  Smad2 cannot bind DNA
CC   and has a large insertion within the hairpin that presumably
CC   abolishes DNA binding. A basic helix (H2) in MH1 with the
CC   nuclear localisation signal KKLKK has been shown to be essential
CC   for Smad3 nuclear import. Smads also use the MH1 domain to
CC   interact with transcription factors such as Jun, TFE3, Sp1, and

DE   MH2 domain
CC   This is the MH2 (MAD homology 2) domain found at the carboxy

CC   The MH2 domain mediates interaction with a wide variety of
CC   proteins and provides specificity and selectivity to Smad
CC   function and also is critical for mediating interactions in Smad
CC   oligomers. Unlike MH1, MH2 does not bind DNA. The well-studied
CC   MH2 domain of Smad4 is composed of five alpha helices and three
CC   loops enclosing a beta sandwich. Smads are involved in the
CC   propagation of TGF-beta signals by direct association with the

CC   periplasmic space along with the ssDNA viral genome [1]. Part of
CC   H is thought to lie outside the shell, where it recognises
CC   lipopolysaccharide from virus-sensitive strains [2].	Part of H
CC   may lie  within the capsid, since mutations in H can influence

DE   Stretch-activated Ca2+-permeable channel component
CC   MID1 is a yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a plasma
CC   membrane protein required for Ca2+ influx induced by the mating
CC   pheromone, alpha-factor. Mid1 protein plays a crucial role in
CC   supplying Ca2+ during the mating process. Mid1 is composed of
CC   548-amino-acid residues with four hydrophobic regions named H1,
CC   H2, H3 and H4, and two cysteine-rich regions (C1 and C2) at the
CC   C-terminal. This family contains the H3, H4, C1 and C2 regions.
CC   suggesting that H1 is a signal sequence responsible for the
CC   alpha-factor-induced Mid1 delivery to the plasma membrane. The
CC   region from H1 to H3 is required for the localisation of Mid1 in
CC   the plasma and ER membranes. Trafficking of Mid1-GFP to the
CC   plasma membrane is dependent on the N-glycosylation of Mid1 and
CC   the transporter protein Sec12. This findings suggests that the
CC   trafficking of Mid1-GFP to the plasma membrane requires a
CC   Sec12-dependent pathway from the ER to the Golgi, and that Mid1
CC   is recruited via a Sec6- and Sec7-independent pathway from the
CC   Golgi to the plasma membrane.

DE   Mlo family
CC   A family of plant integral membrane proteins, first discovered
CC   in barley. Mutants lacking wild-type Mlo proteins show broad

DE   Bacterial mobilisation protein (MobC)
CC   This family consists of several bacterial MobC-like,
CC   mobilisation proteins. MobC proteins belong to the group of
CC   relaxases. Together with MobA and MobB they bind to a single
CC   cis-active site of a mobilising plasmid, the origin of transfer
CC   (oriT) region [1]. The absence of MobC has several different
CC   effects on oriT DNA. Site- and strand-specific nicking by MobA
CC   protein is severely reduced, accounting for the lower frequency
CC   of mobilisation. The localised DNA strand separation required
CC   for this nicking is less affected, but becomes more sensitive to
CC   the level of active DNA gyrase in the cell. In addition, strand
CC   separation is not efficiently extended through the region
CC   containing the nick site. These effects suggest a model in which
CC   MobC acts as a molecular wedge for the relaxosome-induced
CC   melting of oriT DNA. The effect of MobC on strand separation may
CC   be partially complemented by the helical distortion induced by
CC   supercoiling. However, MobC extends the melted region through
CC   the nick site, thus providing the single-stranded substrate
CC   required for cleavage by MobA [2].

DE   Ran-interacting Mog1 protein
CC   Segregation of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes facilitates
CC   regulation of many eukaryotic cellular functions such as gene
CC   expression and cell cycle progression. Trafficking through the

DE   Mpv17 / PMP22 family 
CC   The 22-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP22) is a major
CC   component of peroxisomal membranes. PMP22 seems to be involved
CC   in pore forming activity and may contribute to the unspecific
CC   permeability of the organelle membrane. PMP22 is synthesised on
CC   free cytosolic ribosomes and then directed to the peroxisome
CC   membrane by specific targeting information [1]. Mpv17 is a
CC   closely related peroxisomal protein. In mouse, the Mpv17 protein
CC   is involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis
CC   [2].	More recently a homolog of Mpv17 in S. cerevisiae has been
CC   been found to be an integral membrane protein of the inner
CC   mitochondrial membrane where it has been proposed to have a role
CC   in ethanol metabolism and tolerance during heat-shock [3].
CC   Defects in MPV17 is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion
CC   syndrome (MDDS) and Navajo neurohepatopathy (NNH) [4][5].  MDDS
CC   is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterised
CC   by a reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Primary
CC   mtDNA depletion is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and
CC   may affect single organs, typically muscle or liver, or multiple
CC   tissues.  Individuals with the hepatocerebral form of
CC   mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome have early progressive
CC   liver failure and neurologic abnormalities, hypoglycemia, and
CC   increased lactate in body fluids.  NNH is an autosomal recessive
CC   disease that is prevalent among Navajo children in the South
CC   Western states of America.  The major clinical features are
CC   hepatopathy, peripheral neuropathy, corneal anesthesia and
CC   scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy,
CC   failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with
CC   intercurrent infections. Infantile, childhood, and classic forms
CC   of NNH have been described. Mitochondrial DNA depletion was
CC   detected in the livers of patients, suggesting a primary defect
CC   in mtDNA maintenance [5].

DE   Malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo)
CC   This family consists of several bacterial Malate:quinone
CC   oxidoreductase (Mqo) proteins (EC:1.1.99.16). Mqo takes part in
CC   the citric acid cycle. It oxidises L-malate to oxaloacetate and
CC   donates electrons to ubiquinone-1 and other artificial acceptors
CC   or, via the electron transfer chain, to oxygen. NAD is not an
CC   acceptor and the natural direct acceptor for the enzyme is most
CC   likely a quinone. The enzyme is therefore called malate:quinone
CC   oxidoreductase, abbreviated to Mqo. Mqo is a peripheral membrane
CC   protein and can be released from the membrane by addition of
CC   chelators [1].

CC   This family consists of mammalian MRVI1 proteins which are
CC   related to the lymphoid-restricted membrane protein (JAW1) and
CC   the IP3 receptor associated cGMP kinase substrates A and B
CC   (IRAGA and IRAGB). The function of MRVI1 is unknown although
CC   mutations in the Mrvi1 gene induces myeloid leukaemia by
CC   altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell
CC   growth and/or differentiation so it has been speculated that
CC   Mrvi1 is a tumour suppressor gene [1]. IRAG is very similar in
CC   sequence to MRVI1 and is an essential NO/cGKI-dependent
CC   regulator of IP3-induced calcium release. Activation of cGKI
CC   decreases IP3-stimulated elevations in intracellular calcium,

DE   Nuclear pore RNA shuttling protein Mtr2
CC   Mtr2 is a monomeric, dual-action, RNA-shuttle protein found in

CC   The pore is lined by a subset of NPC members called nucleoporins
CC   that present FG (Phe-Gly) receptors, characteristically GLFG and

CC   by binding to successive FG receptors. Mtr2 when bound to Mex67
CC   maximises this FG-binding. Mtr2 also acts independently of Mex67
CC   in transporting the large ribosomal RNA subunit through the pore
CC   [1].

DE   Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase) family
CC   Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC:2.4.2.11) is the rate
CC   limiting enzyme that catalyses the first reaction in	the NAD

DE   NMDA receptor-regulated gene protein 2
CC   The transition of neuronal cells from pre-cursor to mature state
CC   is regulated by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a
CC   glutamate-gated ion channel that is permeable to Ca2+. NMDA
CC   receptors probably mediate this activity by permitting
CC   expression of NARG2. NARG2 is transiently expressed, being a
CC   regulatory protein that is present in the nucleus of dividing
CC   cells and then down-regulated as progenitors exit the cell cycle
CC   and begin to differentiate. NARG2 contains repeats of (S/T)PXX,
CC   (11 in mouse , six in human), a putative DNA-binding motif that
CC   is found in many gene-regulatory proteins including Kruppel,
CC   Hunchback and Antennapedi [1].

DE   NMDA receptor-regulated protein 1 
CC   This domain family is found in eukaryotes, and is approximately
CC   40 amino acids in length. The family is found in association
CC   with Pfam:PF07719, Pfam:PF00515. There is a single completely
CC   conserved residue L that may be functionally important. NARP1 is
CC   the mammalian homologue of a yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase
CC   that regulates entry into the G(0) phase of the cell cycle.

DE   Nicotianamine synthase protein
CC   Nicotianamine synthase EC:2.5.1.43 catalyses the trimerisation
CC   of S-adenosylmethionine to yield one molecule of nicotianamine.
CC   Nicotianamine has an important role in plant iron uptake
CC   mechanisms.  Plants adopt two strategies (termed I and II) of
CC   iron acquisition.  Strategy I is adopted by all higher plants
CC   except graminaceous plants, which adopt strategy II [1,2]. In
CC   strategy I plants, the role of nicotianamine is not fully
CC   determined: possible roles include the formation of more stable
CC   complexes with ferrous than with ferric ion, which might serve
CC   as a sensor of the physiological status of iron within a plant,
CC   or which might be involved in the transport of iron [1]. In
CC   strategy II (graminaceous) plants, nicotianamine is the key
CC   intermediate (and nicotianamine synthase the key enzyme) in the
CC   synthesis of the mugineic family (the only known family in
CC   plants) of phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are iron
CC   chelators whose secretion by the roots is greatly increased in
CC   instances of iron deficiency [2]. The 3D structures of five
CC   example NAS from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus reveal
CC   the monomer to consist of a five-helical bundle N-terminal
CC   domain on top of a classic Rossmann fold C-terminal domain. The
CC   N-terminal domain is unique to the NAS family, whereas the
CC   C-terminal domain is homologous to the class I family of
CC   SAM-dependent methyltransferases. An active site is created at
CC   the interface of the two domains, at the rim of a large cavity
CC   that corresponds to the nucleotide binding site such as is found
CC   in other proteins adopting a Rossmann fold [3].

DE   N-acetyltransferase B complex (NatB) non catalytic subunit
CC   This is the non-catalytic subunit of the N-terminal
CC   acetyltransferase B complex (NatB). The NatB complex catalyses
CC   the acetylation of the amino-terminal methionine residue of all
CC   proteins beginning with Met-Asp or Met-Glu and of some proteins
CC   beginning with Met-Asn or Met-Met.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae
CC   this subunit is called MDM20 and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe it
CC   is called Arm1.  NatB acetylates the Tpm1 protein and regulates
CC   and tropomyocin-actin interactions.  This subunit is required by
CC   the NatB complex for the N-terminal acetylation of Tpm1 [1].

CC   the proteins. Sodium/calcium exchangers regulate intracellular
CC   Ca2+ concentrations in many cells; cardiac myocytes, epithelial
CC   cells, neurons retinal rod photoreceptors and smooth muscle
CC   cells [2]. Ca2+ is moved into or out of the cytosol depending on
CC   Na+ concentration [2].  In humans and rats there are 3 isoforms;

DE   Na+/H+ antiporter 1
CC   This family contains a number of bacterial Na+/H+ antiporter 1
CC   proteins. These are integral membrane proteins that catalyse the

CC   the pH [1].
AC   PF00999.15
DE   Sodium/hydrogen exchanger family
CC   Na/H antiporters are key transporters in maintaining the pH of
CC   actively metabolising cells. The molecular mechanisms of
CC   antiport are unclear. These antiporters contain 10-12
CC   transmembrane regions (M) at the amino-terminus and a large
CC   cytoplasmic region at the carboxyl terminus.	The transmembrane
CC   regions M3-M12 share identity with other members of the family. 
CC   The M6 and M7 regions are highly conserved. Thus, this is
CC   thought to be the region that is involved in the transport of
CC   sodium and hydrogen ions.  The cytoplasmic region has little
CC   similarity throughout the family.

DE   NfeD-like C-terminal, partner-binding
CC   NfeD-like proteins are widely distributed throughout prokaryotes
CC   and are frequently associated with genes encoding stomatin-like

CC   protease region and associated with their ancestral gene
CC   partner, either yqfA or eoslipin. This NefD, C-terminal, domain
CC   appears to be the major one for relating to the associated

DE   Nitronate monooxygenase
CC   Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO), formerly referred to as
CC   2-nitropropane dioxygenase (NPD) (EC:1.13.11.32), is an
CC   FMN-dependent enzyme that uses molecular oxygen to oxidize
CC   (anionic) alkyl nitronates and, in the case of the enzyme from
CC   Neurospora crassa, (neutral) nitroalkanes to the corresponding
CC   carbonyl compounds and nitrite. Previously classified as
CC   2-nitropropane dioxygenase [1,2,3], but it is now recognized
CC   that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes
CC   to their nitronate (anionic) forms [4]. The enzymes from the
CC   fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Williopsis saturnus var.
CC   mrakii (formerly classified as Hansenula mrakii) contain
CC   non-covalently bound FMN as the cofactor. Active towards linear
CC   alkyl nitronates of lengths between 2 and 6 carbon atoms and,
CC   with lower activity, towards propyl-2-nitronate. The enzyme from
CC   N. crassa can also utilize neutral nitroalkanes, but with lower
CC   activity. One atom of oxygen is incorporated into the carbonyl
CC   group of the aldehyde product. The reaction appears to involve
CC   the formation of an enzyme-bound nitronate radical and an
CC   a-peroxynitroethane species, which then decomposes, either in
CC   the active site of the enzyme or after release, to acetaldehyde
CC   and nitrite.

DE   Nodulation protein Z (NodZ)
CC   The nodulation genes of Rhizobia are regulated by the nodD gene
CC   product in response to host-produced flavonoids and appear to

CC   signal molecule required for infection and nodule formation.
CC   NodZ is required for the addition of a 2-O-methylfucose residue
CC   to the terminal reducing N-acetylglucosamine of the nodulation
CC   signal. This substitution is essential for the biological
CC   activity of this molecule. Mutations in nodZ result in defective

CC   Bacterial infection is required for the induction of
CC   nodule-specific GRP genes, and it is thought that

CC   postmitotic neurogenic tissues in the developing central and
CC   peripheral nervous systems, first appearing after neural tube
CC   closure. It is likely that it forms large multimeric
CC   complexes.It has a divergent function in neurogenesis. In animal
CC   caps neuralized by expression of noggin, co-expression of
CC   Noelin-1 causes expression of neuronal differentiation markers
CC   several stages before neurogenesis normally occurs in this

DE   Nucleoporin Nup120/160
CC   Nup120 is conserved from fungi to plants to humans, and is
CC   homologous with the Nup160 of vertebrates. The nuclear core
CC   complex, or NPC, mediates macromolecular transport across the
CC   nuclear envelope. Deletion of the NUP120 gene causes clustering
CC   of NPCs at one side of the nuclear envelope, moderate nucleolar
CC   fragmentation and slower cell growth [1]. The vertebrate NPC is
CC   estimated to contain between 30 and 60 different proteins. most
CC   of which are not known. Two important ones in creating the
CC   nucleoporin basket are Nup98 and Nup153, and Nup120, in
CC   conjunction with Nup 133, interacts with these two and itself
CC   plays a role in mRNA export [2]. Nup160, Nup133, Nup96, and
CC   Nup107 are all targets of phosphorylation. The phosphorylation
CC   sites are clustered mainly at the N-terminal regions of these
CC   proteins, which are predicted to be natively disordered. The
CC   entire Nup107-160 subcomplex is stable throughout the cell
CC   cycle, thus it seems unlikely that phosphorylation affects
CC   interactions within the Nup107-160 subcomplex, but rather that
CC   it regulates the association of the subcomplex with the NPC and
CC   other proteins [2].

DE   Nucleoporin subcomplex protein binding to Pom34
CC   This is one of the many peptides that make up the nucleoporin

CC   subcomplex (Nic96p-Nup188p-Nup192p-Pom152p) is one of at least
CC   six that make up the NPC, and as such is symmetrically localised

AC   PF08911.5
DE   NUP50 (Nucleoporin 50 kDa)
CC   Nucleoporin 50 kDa (NUP50) acts as a cofactor for the
CC   importin-alpha:importin-beta heterodimer, which in turn allows
CC   for transportation of many nuclear-targeted proteins through
CC   nuclear pore complexes. The C terminus of NUP50 binds
CC   importin-beta through RAN-GTP, the N terminus binds the C
CC   terminus of importin-alpha, while a central domain binds
CC   importin-beta. NUP50:importin-alpha:importin-beta then binds
CC   cargo and can stimulate nuclear import. The N-terminal domain of
CC   NUP50 is also able to actively displace nuclear localisation
CC   signals from importin-alpha [1].

DE   Nuclear protein 96
CC   Nup96 (often known by the name of its yeast homolog Nup145C) is
CC   part of the Nup84 heptameric complex in the nuclear pore
CC   complex. Nup96 complexes with Sec13 in the middle of the
CC   heptamer. The function of the heptamer is to coat the curvature
CC   of the nuclear pore complex between the inner and outer nuclear
CC   membranes. Nup96 is predicted to be an alpha helical solenoid.
CC   The interaction between Nup96 and Sec13 is the point of
CC   curvature in the heptameric complex. [1] [2]

CC   Such proteins are crucial for the regulation of cell cycle
CC   progression. On the other hand, little is known about NUT
CC   protein. NUT is known to have a Nuclear Export Sequence (NES) as

CC   These domains are found in the eukaryotic proteins typified by

CC   suggest that PIN and NYN domains are likely to bind only a
CC   single metal ion, unlike the FLAP/5' --> 3' exonuclease
CC   superfamily, which binds two metal ions. Based on conserved gene

CC   been identified mostly in human and rat. Different OATPs vary in
CC   tissue distribution and substrate specificity. Since the
CC   numbering of different OATPs in particular species was based
CC   originally on the order of discovery, similarly numbered OATPs
CC   in humans and rats did not necessarily correspond in function,
CC   tissue distribution and substrate specificity (in spite of the
CC   name, some OATPs also transport organic cations and neutral 
CC   molecules). Thus, Tamai et al. [1] initiated the current scheme
CC   of using digits for rat OATPs and letters for human ones.
CC   Prostaglandin transporter (PGT) proteins (e.g. Swiss:Q92959) are
CC   also	considered to be OATP family members. In addition, the
CC   methotrexate transporter OATK (Swiss:P70502) is closely related
CC   to OATPs. This family also includes several predicted proteins
CC   from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. This
CC   similarity was not previously noted. Note: Members of this
CC   family are described (in the Swiss-Prot database) as belonging
CC   to the SLC21 family of transporters.

DE   Oxoglutarate and iron-dependent oxygenase degradation C-term
CC   Ofd1 is a prolyl 4-hydroxylase-like 2-oxoglutarate-Fe(II)
CC   dioxygenase that accelerates the degradation of Sre1N in the
CC   presence of oxygen.  The domain is conserved from yeasts to
CC   humans. Yeast Sre1 is the orthologue of mammalian sterol

CC   measure of oxygen availability. However, unlike the prolyl
CC   4-hydroxylases that regulate mammalian hypoxia-inducible factor,
CC   Ofd1 uses multiple domains to regulate Sre1N degradation by
CC   oxygen; the Ofd1 N-terminal dioxygenase domain is required for

CC   in diverse proteases. The PA domain is also found in a plant
CC   vacuolar sorting receptor Swiss:O22925 and members of the RZF
CC   family Swiss:O43567. It has been suggested that this domain
CC   forms a lid-like structure that covers the active site in active

DE   Fucose-binding lectin II (PA-IIL)
CC   In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the fucose-binding lectin II (PA-IIL)
CC   contributes to the pathogenic virulence of the bacterium. PA-IIL
CC   functions as a tetramer when binding fucose. Each monomer is
CC   comprised of a nine-stranded, antiparallel beta-sandwich
CC   arrangement and contains two calcium cations that mediate the
CC   binding of fucose in a recognition mode unique among

DE   PA-IL-like protein
CC   The members of this family are similar to the galactophilic 
CC   lectin-1 expressed by P. aeruginosa ((PA-IL, Swiss:Q05097). 
CC   Lectins recognising specific carbohydrates found on the  surface
CC   of host cells are known to be involved in the  initiation of
CC   infections by this organism. The protein is thought to be
CC   organised into an extensive network of beta-sheets, as is the
CC   case with many other lectins [1].
AC   PF07691.6
DE   PA14 domain
CC   This domain forms an insert in bacterial beta-glucosidases and
CC   is found in other glycosidases, glycosyltransferases, proteases,
CC   amidases, yeast adhesins, and bacterial toxins, including
CC   anthrax protective antigen (PA). The domain also occurs in a
CC   Dictyostelium prespore-cell-inducing factor Psi and in
CC   fibrocystin, the mammalian protein whose mutation leads to
CC   polycystic kidney and hepatic disease. The crystal structure of
CC   PA shows that this domain (named PA14 after its location in the
CC   PA20 pro-peptide) has a beta-barrel structure. The PA14 domain
CC   sequence suggests a binding function, rather than a catalytic
CC   role. The PA14 domain distribution is compatible with
CC   carbohydrate binding.

DE   Poly-adenylate binding protein, unique domain
CC   The region featured in this family is found towards the
CC   C-terminus of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs). These are
CC   eukaryotic proteins that, through their binding of the 3'
CC   poly(A) tail on mRNA, have very important roles in the pathways
CC   of gene expression. They seem to provide a scaffold on which
CC   other proteins can bind and mediate processes such as export,
CC   translation and turnover of the transcripts. Moreover, they may
CC   act as antagonists to the binding of factors that allow mRNA
CC   degradation, regulating mRNA longevity. PABPs are also involved
CC   in nuclear transport. PABPs interact with poly(A) tails via
CC   RNA-recognition motifs (Pfam:PF00076) [1]. Note that the PABP
CC   C-terminal region is also found in members of the hyperplastic
CC   discs protein (HYD) family of ubiquitin ligases that contain

DE   PAC2 family
CC   This PAC2 (Proteasome assembly chaperone) family of proteins is
CC   found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.  Proteins in this
CC   family are typically between 247 and 307 amino acids in length.
CC   These proteins function as a chaperone for the 26S proteasome.
CC   The 26S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in
CC   eukaryotic cells. A number of studies including very recent ones
CC   have revealed that assembly of its 20S catalytic core particle
CC   is an ordered process that involves several conserved proteasome
CC   assembly chaperones (PACs). Two heterodimeric chaperones,
CC   PAC1-PAC2 and PAC3-PAC4, promote the assembly of rings composed
CC   of seven alpha subunits [4].

DE   PACS-1 cytosolic sorting protein
CC   PACS-1 is a cytosolic sorting protein that directs the
CC   localisation of membrane proteins in the trans-Golgi network
CC   (TGN)/endosomal system. PACS-1 connects the clathrin adaptor
CC   AP-1 to acidic cluster sorting motifs contained in the
CC   cytoplasmic domain of cargo proteins such as furin, the

CC   proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef [1].
AC   PF10495.3
DE   Pericentrin-AKAP-450 domain of centrosomal targeting protein
CC   This domain is a coiled-coil region close to the C-terminus of
CC   centrosomal proteins that is directly responsible for recruiting
CC   AKAP-450 and pericentrin to the centrosome. Hence the suggested
CC   name for this region is a PACT domain (pericentrin-AKAP-450
CC   centrosomal targeting). This domain is also present at the
CC   C-terminus of coiled-coil proteins from Drosophila and S. pombe,
CC   and that from the Drosophila protein is sufficient for targeting
CC   to the centrosome in mammalian cells. The function of these
CC   proteins is unknown but they seem good candidates for having a
CC   centrosomal or spindle pole body location. The final 22 residues
CC   of this domain in AKAP-450 appear specifically to be a
CC   calmodulin-binding domain indicating that this member at least
CC   is likely to contribute to centrosome assembly [1].

DE   Porphyromonas-type peptidyl-arginine deiminase
CC   Peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes catalyse the
CC   deimination of the guanidino group from carboxy-terminal
CC   arginine residues of various peptides to produce ammonia.  PAD
CC   from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PPAD) appears to be
CC   evolutionarily unrelated to mammalian PAD (Pfam:PF03068), which
CC   is a metalloenzyme.  PPAD is thought to belong to the same
CC   superfamily as aminotransferase and arginine deiminase, and to
CC   form an alpha/beta propeller structure. This family has
CC   previously been named PPADH (Porphyromonas peptidyl-arginine
CC   deiminase homologues) [1]. The predicted catalytic residues in
CC   PPAD (Swiss:Q9RQJ2) are Asp130, Asp187, His236, Asp238 and
CC   Cys351 [1]. These are absolutely conserved with the exception of
CC   Asp187 which is absent in two family members.  PPAD is also able
CC   to catalyse the deimination of free L-arginine, but has
CC   primarily peptidyl-arginine specificity.  It may have a FMN
CC   cofactor [2].

DE   Pam16
CC   The Pam16 protein (Swiss:P42949) is the fifth essential subunit

CC   (PAM) [1].  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pam16 is required for
CC   preprotein translocation into the matrix, but not for protein
CC   insertion into the inner membrane [1].  Pam16 has a degenerate J
CC   domain.  J-domain proteins play important regulatory roles as
CC   co-chaperones, recruiting Hsp70 partners and accelerating the
CC   ATP-hydrolysis step of the chaperone cycle [2].  Pam16's J-like
CC   domain strongly interacts with Pam18's J domain, leading to a

DE   Paramyxovirinae P phosphoprotein C-terminal region
CC   The subfamily Paramyxovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae now
CC   contains as main genera the Rubulaviruses, avulaviruses,
CC   respiroviruses, Henipavirus-es and morbilliviruses.  Protein P
CC   is the best characterised, structurally of the replicative
CC   complex of N, P and L proteins and consists of two functionally
CC   distinct moieties, an N-terminal PNT, and a C-terminal PCT [1].
CC   The P protein is an essential part of the viral RNA polymerase
CC   complex formed from the P and L proteins [1]. P protein plays a
CC   crucial role in the enzyme by positioning L onto the N/RNA
CC   template through an interaction with the C-terminal domain of N.
CC   Without P, L is not functional.The C-terminal part of P (PCT) is
CC   only functional as an oligomer and forms with L the polymerase
CC   complex. PNT is poorly conserved and unstructured in solution
CC   while PCT contains the oligomerisation domain (PMD) that folds
CC   as a homotetrameric coiled coil (40) containing the L binding
CC   region and a C-terminal partially folded domain, PX (residues
CC   474 to 568), identified as the nucleocapsid binding site.
CC   Interestingly, PX is also expressed as an independent
CC   polypeptide in infected cells. PX has a C-subdomain (residues
CC   516 to 568) that consists of three {alpha}-helices arranged in
CC   an antiparallel triple-helical bundle linked to an unfolded
CC   flexible N-subdomain (residues 474 to 515).

DE   Paramyxovirus P/V phosphoprotein C-terminal
CC   Paramyxoviral P genes are able to generate more than one
CC   product, using alternative reading frames and RNA editing. The P
CC   gene encodes the structural phosphoprotein P. In addition, it
CC   encodes several non-structural proteins present in the infected
CC   cell but not in the virus particle. This family includes
CC   phosphoprotein P and the non-structural phosphoprotein V from
CC   different paramyxoviruses.  Phosphoprotein P is essential for
CC   the activity of the RNA polymerase complex which it forms with
CC   another subunit, L Pfam:PF00946. Although all the catalytic
CC   activities of the polymerase are associated with the L subunit,
CC   its function requires specific interactions with phosphoprotein
CC   P [2]. The P and V phosphoproteins are amino co-terminal, but
CC   diverge at their C-termini. This difference is generated by an
CC   RNA-editing mechanism in which one or two non-templated G
CC   residues are inserted into P-gene-derived mRNA. In measles virus
CC   and Sendai virus, one G residue is inserted and the edited
CC   transcript encodes the V protein. In mumps, simian virus type 5
CC   and Newcastle disease virus, two G residues are inserted, and
CC   the edited transcript codes for the P protein [2]. Being
CC   phosphoproteins, both P and V are rich in serine and threonine
CC   residues over their whole lengths. In addition, the V proteins
CC   are rich in cysteine residues at the C-termini [3]. This
CC   C-terminal region of the P phosphoprotein is likely to be the
CC   nucleocapsid-binding domain.

CC   polymerase activity on the complex.  The P protein acts as a
CC   transcription factor [2].

CC   The HTH motifs emanate from a beta sheet coiled coil DNA binding
CC   module [1]. Both DNA binding elements are free to rotate around

DE   Beta-satellite pathogenicity beta C1 protein
CC   Cotton leaf-curl disease - CLCuD - is of major economic

DE   Influenza A Proapoptotic protein
CC   PB1-F2 is a protein found in almost all known strains of

CC    Although the protein has originally been described to induce

DE   Peptidase C39 family
CC   Lantibiotic and non-lantibiotic bacteriocins are synthesised as
CC   precursor peptides containing N-terminal extensions (leader
CC   peptides) which are cleaved off during maturation. Most
CC   non-lantibiotics and also some lantibiotics have leader peptides
CC   of the so-called double-glycine type. These leader peptides
CC   share consensus sequences and also a common processing site with
CC   two conserved glycine residues in positions -1 and -2. The
CC   double- glycine-type leader peptides are unrelated to the
CC   N-terminal signal sequences which direct proteins across the

CC   are also different from typical signal peptidase cleavage sites,
CC   suggesting that a different processing enzyme is involved.
CC   Peptide bacteriocins are exported across the cytoplasmic
CC   membrane by a dedicated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.
CC   The ABC transporter is the maturation protease  and its
CC   proteolytic domain resides in the N-terminal part of the protein

DE   Poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate polymerase (PhaC) N-terminus
CC   This family represents the N-terminal region of the bacterial

DE   Regulatory phage protein cox
CC   This family of phage Cox proteins is expressed by Enterobacteria

CC   integrative recombination and it activates site-specific
CC   excision of the HP1 genome from the Haemophilus influenzae
CC   chromosome, Hp1. Cox appears to function as a tetramer. Cox
CC   binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus

DE   phiKZ-like phage internal head proteins
CC   Phage internal head proteins (IP) are proteins that are encoded

CC   are those of bacteriophage T4, which are known to be
CC   proteolytically processed during phage maturation, and then
CC   subsequently injected into the host cell during infection. The
CC   phiKZ_IP family consists of internal head proteins encoded by
CC   phiKZ-like phages.  Each phage encodes three to six members of
CC   this family [1].  Members of the family reside in the head [2]
CC   and are cleaved during phage maturation to separate an
CC   N-terminal propeptide from a C-terminal domain.  The C-terminal
CC   domain remains in the mature capsid.	The N-terminal propeptide
CC   domain is either mostly or completely removed from the mature

CC   typically between 101 and 140 amino acids in length. Phtf
CC   proteins do not display any sequence similarity to known or

CC   This PIN (PilT N terminus) domain is a compact domain of about
CC   100 amino acids.  The domain has two nearly invariant
CC   aspartates. The function of the PIN domain is unknown but a role
CC   in signaling appears likely given the presence of this domain is
CC   StbB Swiss:Q52562 and DIS3 Swiss:Q08162 (Not matched by the Pfam
CC   HMM) [1]. The majority of PIN-domain proteins found in
CC   prokaryotes are the toxic components of toxin-antitoxin operon,
CC   and toxin-antitoxin gene cassettes, though first found in
CC   plasmids, are found to be abundant in free-living prokaryotes,
CC   including many pathogenic bacteria.  These loci provide a
CC   control mechanism that helps free-living prokaryotes cope with
CC   nutritional stress [3]. In many genomes PIN domains are
CC   annotated as VapC and are part of the VapBC toxin-antitoxin
CC   operons. These operons are expanded in number in several
CC   unrelated micro-organisisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis
CC   and Sulfolobus solfataricus [4].

DE   pinin/SDK/memA/ protein conserved region
CC   Members of this family have very varied localisations within the
CC   eukaryotic cell. pinin is known to localise at the desmosomes
CC   and is implicated in anchoring intermediate filaments to the
CC   desmosomal plaque [1].  SDK2/3 is a dynamically localised
CC   nuclear protein thought to be involved in modulation of
CC   alternative pre-mRNA splicing [2].  memA is a tumour marker
CC   preferentially expressed in human melanoma cell lines.  A common
CC   feature of the members of this family is that they may all
CC   participate in regulating protein-protein interactions [3].

CC   SDK2/3 is localised in nuclear speckles where as pinin is known
CC   to localise at the desmosomes where it is thought to be involved
CC   in anchoring intermediate filaments to the desmosomal plaque
CC   [1,2]. The role of SDK2/3 in the nucleus is thought to be
CC   concerned with modulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing [4].

DE   Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-Kinase
CC   This family contains a region from the common kinase core found
CC   in the type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K)
CC   family as described in [1]. The family consists of various type
CC   I, II and III PIP5K enzymes. PIP5K catalyses the formation of

DE   Yeast PIR protein repeat
AC   PF02678.10
DE   Pirin
CC   This family consists of Pirin proteins from both eukaryotes and
CC   prokaryotes. The function of Pirin is unknown but the gene
CC   coding for this protein is known to be expressed in all tissues
CC   in the human body although it is expressed most strongly in the
CC   liver and heart. Pirin is known to be a nuclear protein,
CC   exclusively localised within the nucleoplasma and predominantly
CC   concentrated within dot-like subnuclear structures [1]. A tomato
CC   homologue of human Pirin has been found to be induced during
CC   programmed cell death [2]. Human Pirin interacts with Bcl-3 and
CC   NFI [3] and hence is probably involved in the regulation of DNA
CC   transcription and replication. It appears to be an
CC   Fe(II)-containing member of the Cupin superfamily.

DE   Piwi domain
CC   This domain is found in the protein Piwi and its relatives.  The
CC   function of this domain is the dsRNA guided hydrolysis of ssRNA.
CC   Determination of the crystal structure of Argonaute reveals that
CC   PIWI is an RNase H domain, and identifies Argonaute as Slicer,
CC   the enzyme that cleaves mRNA in the RNAi RISC complex [2].  In
CC   addition, Mg+2 dependence and production of 3'-OH and 5'
CC   phosphate products are shared characteristics of RNaseH and
CC   RISC. The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to
CC   the RNase H family of enzymes.  RNase H fold proteins all have a
CC   five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices. By analogy
CC   to RNase H enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA guided by
CC   the DNA strand in an RNA/DNA hybrid, the PIWI domain can be
CC   inferred to cleave single-stranded RNA, for example mRNA, guided
CC   by double stranded siRNA.

DE   Plasmid maintenance system killer protein
CC   Several plasmids with proteic killer gene systems have been
CC   reported. All of them encode a stable toxin and an unstable
CC   antidote. Upon loss of the plasmid, the less stable inhibitor is
CC   inactivated more rapidly than the toxin, allowing the toxin to
CC   be activated. The activation of those systems result in cell

DE   Toxin of toxin-antitoxin type 1 system
CC   This family is the toxin of a type 1 toxin-antitoxin system
CC   which is found in a relatively widespread range of bacterial
CC   species. The species distribution suggests frequent horizontal
CC   gene transfer.  In a type 1 system, as characterised for the
CC   plasmid-encoded E coli hok/sok system, the toxin-encoding stable
CC   mRNA encodes a protein which rapidly leads to cell death unless
CC   the translation is suppressed by a short-lived small RNA. The
CC   plasmid-encoded module prevents the growth of plasmid-free
CC   offspring, thus ensuring the persistence of the plasmid in the
CC   population. Plasmid-free cells arising after cell-division will
CC   be killed because the stable mRNA toxin is present while the
CC   comparably unstable anti-toxin is rapidly degraded. Where the
CC   system is transcribed chromosomally, the mechanism is poorly
CC   understood (Findeiss et al A novel family of plasmid-transferred
CC   anti-sense ncRNAs, submitted to RNA Biology).
AC   PF06769.7
DE   Plasmid encoded toxin Txe
CC   The plasmid encoded Axe-Txe proteins in Enterococcus faecium act
CC   as an antitoxin-toxin pair.  When the plasmid is lost, the
CC   antitoxin (Axe) is degraded relatively quickly by host enzymes.
CC   This allows the toxin to interact with its intracellular target,
CC   thus killing the cell or impeding cell growth [1]. This family
CC   contains many hypothetical proteins.

CC   associated proteins. It is called the PLAT (Polycystin-1,
CC   Lipoxygenase, Alpha-Toxin) domain or LH2 (Lipoxygenase homology)
CC   domain.  The known structure of pancreatic lipase shows this
CC   domain binds to procolipase Pfam:PF01114, which mediates
CC   membrane association. So it appears possible that this domain
CC   mediates membrane attachment via other protein binding partners.

DE   Phospholipase D Active site motif
CC   Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms
CC   are activated by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). PLD produces
CC   phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine, which may be
CC   essential for the formation of certain types of transport
CC   vesicles or may be constitutive vesicular transport to signal
CC   transduction pathways.  PC-hydrolysing PLD is a homologue of
CC   cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial
CC   PLDs, and viral proteins. Each of these appears to possess a
CC   domain duplication which is apparent by the presence of two
CC   motifs containing well-conserved histidine, lysine, and/or
CC   asparagine residues which may contribute to the active site.
CC   aspartic acid.  An E. coli endonuclease (nuc) and similar
CC   proteins appear to be PLD homologues but possess only one of

DE   Phospholipase D/viral envelope
CC   This domain is found in phospholipases and viral envelope
CC   proteins between Phospholipase D (PLD) active site motifs
CC   (Pfam:PF00641).  PLD is associated with Golgi membranes and
CC   alters their lipid content by the conversion of phospholipids

DE   Plus-3 domain
CC   This domain is about 90 residues in length and is often found
CC   associated with the Pfam:PF02213 domain.  The function of this
CC   domain is uncertain. It is possible that this domain is involved
CC   in DNA binding as it has three conserved positively charged

CC   constitutive repressor of eIF2-alpha phosphorylation/protein
CC   phosphatase 1, regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 15b, otherwise
CC   known as CReP. Diverse stressful conditions are associated with
CC   phosphorylation of the {alpha} subunit of eukaryotic translation
CC   initiation factor 2 (eIF2{alpha}) on serine 51. This signaling
CC   event, which is conserved from yeast to mammals, negatively
CC   regulates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2-B and
CC   inhibits the recycling of eIF2 to its active GTP bound form. In

CC   expression at both the translational and transcriptional levels
CC   [1].

DE   Prefoldin subunit
CC   This family comprises of several prefoldin subunits. The
CC   biogenesis of the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin
CC   involves interaction of nascent chains of each of the two
CC   proteins with the oligomeric protein prefoldin (PFD) and their
CC   subsequent transfer to the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (chaperonin
CC   containing TCP-1). Electron microscopy shows that eukaryotic
CC   PFD, which has a similar structure to its archaeal counterpart,
CC   interacts with unfolded actin along the tips of its projecting
CC   arms. In its PFD-bound state, actin seems to acquire a
CC   conformation similar to that adopted when it is bound to CCT
CC   [1].

DE   Plasmodium RESA C-terminal
CC   The short, four-helical domain first identified in the
CC   Plasmodium export proteins PHISTa and PHISTc [1] has been
CC   extended to become this six-helical PRESAC domain identified in
CC   the P. falciparum-specific RESA-type (Ring-infected erythrocyte
CC   surface antigen) proteins in association with the DnaJ domain.
CC   Overall, at least 67 proteins have been detected in P.
CC   falciparum with complete copies of the PRESAC domain. No
CC   versions of this domain were detected in other apicomplexan
CC   genera, suggesting that the domain was 'invented' after the
CC   divergence of the lineage leading to the genus Plasmodium
CC   undergoing a dramatic proliferation only in P. falciparum. A
CC   secondary structure-prediction derived from the multiple

CC   at the N-terminus. The domain is essential for the import
CC   process by which ALAS is transported into the mitochondria:
CC   translocase of the outer membrane (Tom) and translocase of the
CC   inner membrane protein complexes appear responsible for
CC   recognition and import through the mitochondrial membrane. The
CC   protein Tom20 is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane,

DE   Proteasome non-ATPase 26S subunit
CC   The 26S proteasome, a eukaryotic ATP-dependent, dumb-bell

CC   possible regulatory roles,composed of multiple subunits of 25-
CC   110 kDa attached to the central portion in opposite
CC   orientations. It is responsible for degradation of abnormal

CC   proteasome comprises a cylindrical stack of four rings, two
CC   outer rings formed by seven alpha-subunits (alpha1-alpha7) and
CC   two inner rings of seven beta-subunits (beta1-beta7). Two outer
CC   rings of alpha subunits maintain structure, while the central
CC   beta rings contain the proteolytic active core subunits beta1

DE   Proteasome complex subunit Rpn13 ubiquitin receptor
CC   This family was thought originally to be involved in
CC   cell-adhesion [1,2], but the members are now known to be
CC   proteasome subunit Rpn13, a novel ubiquitin receptor. The 26S
CC   proteasome is a huge macromolecular protein-degradation machine
CC   consisting of a proteolytically active 20S core, in the form of
CC   four disc-like proteins, and one or two 19S regulatory
CC   particles. The regulatory particle(s) sit on the top and or
CC   bottom of the core, de-ubiquitinate the substrate peptides,
CC   unfold them and guide them into the narrow channel through the
CC   centre of the core. Rpn13 and its homologues dock onto the
CC   regulatory particle through the N-terminal region which binds
CC   Rpn2. The C-terminal part of the domain binds de-ubiquitinating
CC   enzyme Uch37/UCHL5 and enhances its isopeptidase activity. Rpn13
CC   binds ubiquitin via a conserved amino-terminal region called the
CC   pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin, termed Pru, domain [4].

DE   Pumilio-family RNA binding repeat
CC   Puf repeats (aka PUM-HD, Pumilio homology domain) are necessary
CC   and sufficient for sequence specific RNA binding in fly Pumilio
CC   and worm FBF-1 and FBF-2. Both proteins function as
CC   translational repressors in early embryonic development by
CC   binding sequences in the 3' UTR of target mRNAs (e.g. the nanos
CC   response element (NRE) in fly Hunchback mRNA, or the point

DE   Pup-like protein
CC   This family consists of several short bacterial proteins formely
CC   known as (DUF797).  It was recently shown that Mycobacterium
CC   tuberculosis contains a small protein, Pup (Rv2111c), that is
CC   covalently conjugated to the e-NH2 groups of lysines on several
CC   target proteins (pupylation) such as the malonyl CoA acyl
CC   carrier protein (FabD) [2]. Pupylation of FabD was shown to
CC   result in its recruitment to the mycobacterial proteasome and
CC   subsequent degradation analogous to eukaryotic
CC   ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Searches recovered Pup orthologs
CC   in all major actinobacteria lineages including the basal
CC   bifidobacteria and also sporadically in certain other bacterial
CC   lineages. [1] The Pup proteins were all between 50-90 residues
CC   in length and a multiple alignment shows that they all contain a
CC   conserved motif with a G [EQ] signature at the C-terminus. Thus,
CC   all of them are suitable for conjugation via the terminal
CC   glutamate or the deamidated glutamine (as shown in the case of
CC   the Mycobacterium Pup [1]). The conserved globular core of Pup
CC   is predicted to form a bihelical unit with the extreme
CC   C-terminal 6-7 residues forming a tail in the extended
CC   conformation. Thus, Pup is structurally unrelated to the
CC   ubiquitin fold and has convergently evolved the function of
CC   protein modifier.

DE   Rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP-1)
CC   Members of this family are found in Babesia species. Though not
CC   in this Pfam family, rhoptry-associated proteins are also found
CC   in Plasmodium falciparum. Indeed, animal infection with Babesia
CC   may produce a pattern similar to human malaria [4]. Rhoptry
CC   organelles form part of the apical complex in apicomplexan
CC   parasites. Rhoptry-associated proteins are antigenic, and
CC   generate partially protective immune responses in infected
CC   mammals. Thus RAPs are among the targeted vaccine antigens for
CC   babesial (and malarial) parasites. However, RAP-1 proteins are
CC   encoded by by a multigene family; thus RAP-1 proteins are
CC   polymorphic, with  B and T cell epitopes that are conserved
CC   among strains, but not across species [1,2,5]. Antibodies to

CC   known, but structurally it forms an alpha-beta fold in nature
CC   with a central beta-sheet flanked by helices and loops, the

DE   Rapsyn N-terminal myristoylation and linker region
CC   Neuromuscular junction formation relies upon the clustering of

CC   membrane. Rapsyn is a peripheral membrane protein that is
CC   selectively concentrated at the neuromuscular junction and is
CC   essential for the formation of synaptic acetylcholine receptor
CC   aggregates. Acetylcholine receptors fail to aggregate beneath
CC   nerve terminals in mice where rapsyn has been knocked out. The
CC   N-terminal six amino acids of rapsyn are its myristoylation
CC   site, and myristoylation is necessary for the targeting of the

CC   vacuolar ATPase V1 and V0 subunits.
AC   PF12768.1
DE   Cortical protein marker for cell polarity
CC   Diploid yeast cells repeatedly polarize and bud from their
CC   poles, due probably to the presence of highly stable membrane
CC   markers, and Rax2 is one such marker. It is inherited immutably
CC   at the cell cortex for multiple generations, and has a half-life
CC   exceeding several generations. The persistent inheritance of
CC   cortical protein markers would provide a means of coupling a
CC   cell's history with the future development of a precise
CC   morphogenetic form [1]. Both Rax1 and Rax2 localise to the
CC   distal pole as well as to the division site and they interact
CC   both with each other and with Bud8p and Bud9p in the
CC   establishment and/or maintenance of the cortical markers for
CC   bipolar budding [2]. thus Rax2 is likely to control cell
CC   polarity during vegetative growth, and in fission yeast this is
CC   done by regulating the localisation of for3p [3].

DE   Rb C-terminal domain
CC   The Rb C-terminal domain is required for high-affinity binding
CC   to E2F-DP complexes and for maximal repression of E2F-responsive

AC   PF12273.2
DE   Chitin synthesis regulation, resistance to Congo red
CC   RCR proteins are ER membrane proteins that regulate chitin
CC   deposition in fungal cell walls. Although chitin, a linear
CC   polymer of beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine, constitutes only
CC   2% of the cell wall it plays a vital role in the overall
CC   protection of the cell wall against stress, noxious chemicals
CC   and osmotic pressure changes. Congo red is a cell
CC   wall-disrupting benzidine-type dye extensively used in many cell
CC   wall mutant studies that specifically targets chitin in yeast
CC   cells and inhibits growth. RCR proteins render the yeasts
CC   resistant to Congo red by diminishing the content of chitin in

CC   those from the temporal half of the retina. Temporal retinal
CC   axons invade the anterior optic tectum in a superficial layer,
CC   and encounter RGM expressed in a gradient with increasing
CC   concentration along the anterior-posterior axis. Temporal axons
CC   are able to receive posterior-dependent information by sensing

DE   Regulator of G protein signalling-like domain
CC   Members of this family adopt a structure consisting of twelve
CC   helices that fold into a compact domain that contains the
CC   overall structural scaffold observed in other RGS proteins and
CC   three additional helical elements that pack closely to it.
CC   Helices 1-9 comprise the RGS (Pfam:PF00615) fold, in which
CC   helices 4-7 form a classic antiparallel bundle adjacent to the
CC   other helices. Like other RGS structures, helices 7 and 8 span
CC   the length of the folded domain and form essentially one
CC   continuous helix with a kink in the middle. Helices 10-12 form
CC   an apparently stable C-terminal extension of the structural
CC   domain, and although other RGS proteins lack this structure,
CC   these elements are intimately associated with the rest of the
CC   structural framework by hydrophobic interactions. Members of the
CC   family bind to active G-alpha proteins, promoting GTP hydrolysis
CC   by the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, thereby

DE   Amino terminal of the G-protein receptor rhodopsin
CC   Rhodopsin is the archetypal G-protein-coupled receptor. Such

CC   Ribophorin I is an essential subunit of
CC   oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which is also known as
CC   Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase,
CC   (EC:2.4.1.119).  OST catalyses the transfer of an

CC   asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as they are
CC   translocated into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. 
CC   Ribophorin I and OST48 are though to be responsible for OST
CC   catalytic activity [1]. Both yeast and mammalian proteins are

CC   proteins, Ipi1 and Ipi3, to form the RIX1 complex that allows
CC   Rea1 - the AAA ATPase - to associate with the 60S ribosomal
CC   subunit. More than 170 assembly factors are involved in the
CC   construction and maturation of yeast ribosomes, and after these
CC   factors have completed their function they need to be released
CC   from the pre-ribosomes. Rea1 induces the release of the assembly
CC   protein complex in a mechanical fashion [3]. This family is
CC   usually associated with NUC202, Pfam:PF08166.

AC   PF10493.3
DE   Rough deal protein C-terminal region
CC   Rod, the Rough deal protein, displays a dynamic intracellular
CC   staining pattern, localising first to kinetochores in
CC   pro-metaphase, but moving to kinetochore microtubules at
CC   metaphase. Early in anaphase the protein is once again
CC   restricted to the kinetochores, where it persists until the end
CC   of telophase. This behaviour is in all respects similar to that
CC   described for ZW10 [1], and indeed the two proteins function
CC   together, localisation of each depending upon the other [2].
CC   These two proteins are found at the kinetochore in complex with
CC   a third, Zwilch, in both flies and humans. The C-terminus is the
CC   most conserved part of the protein. During pro-metaphase, the
CC   ZW10-Rod complex, dynein/dynactin, and Mad2 all accumulate on
CC   unattached kinetochores; microtubule capture leads to Mad2
CC   depletion as it is carried off by dynein/dynactin; ZW10-Rod
CC   complex accumulation continues, replenishing kinetochore dynein.
CC   The continuing recruitment of the ZW10-Rod complex during
CC   metaphase may serve to maintain adequate dynein/dynactin complex
CC   on kinetochores for assisting chromatid movement during
CC   anaphase[2]. The ZW10-Rod complex acts as a bridge whose
CC   association with Zwint-1 links Mad1 and Mad2, components that
CC   are directly responsible for generating the diffusible 'wait
CC   anaphase' signal, to a structural, inner kinetochore complex
CC   containing Mis12 and KNL-1AF15q14, the last of which has been
CC   proved to be essential for kinetochore assembly in C. elegans.

DE   Reactive mitochondrial oxygen species modulator 1
CC   This is a family of small, approximately 100 amino acid,
CC   proteins found from yeasts to humans. The majority of endogenous

CC   alters the intracellular redox homeostasis, triggers DNA damage,
CC   and may contribute to cancer development and progression [1].
CC   Members of this family are mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
CC   modulator 1 (Romo1) proteins that are responsible for increasing

CC   protein that specifically represses the virC and virD operons in
CC   the virulence region of the Ti plasmid [1] and is necessary for
CC   succinoglycan production [2]. Sinorhizobium meliloti can produce
CC   two types of acidic exopolysaccharides, succinoglycan and
CC   galactoglucan, that are interchangeable for infection of alfalfa
CC   nodules. MucR from Sinorhizobium meliloti acts as a
CC   transcriptional repressor that blocks the expression of the exp
CC   genes responsible for galactoglucan production therefore
CC   allowing the exclusive production of succinoglycan [3].
AC   PF10681.3
DE   Chaperone for protein-folding within the ER, fungal
CC   This conserved fungal family is an essential molecular chaperone
CC   in the endoplasmic reticulum. Molecular chaperones transiently
CC   interact with unfolded proteins to inhibit their

CC   Rot1 is a general chaperone with some substrate specificity, its
CC   substrates being the structurally unrelated Kre5 Kre6 Big1
CC   Atg22, which are type I, type II, and polytopic membrane
CC   proteins. The dependencies of each for Rot1 do not share
CC   similarities. However, their folding does require BiP, and one

CC   containing heptapeptide repeats mediating oligomerisation and a
CC   leucine zipper motif [2]. NSP3 may play a central role in
CC   replication and assembly of genomic RNA structures [2].
CC   Rotaviruses have a dsRNA genome and are a major cause cause of
CC   acute gastroenteritis in the young of many species [1]. The
CC   rotavirus non-structural protein NSP3 is a sequence-specific RNA
CC   binding protein that binds the nonpolyadenylated 3' end of the

DE   RNA recognition motif of the spliceosomal PrP8
CC   The large RNA-protein complex of the spliceosome catalyses

DE   RNA polymerase I specific transcription initiation factor
CC   Initiation of transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in yeast
CC   involves an interaction of upstream activation factor (UAF) with

CC   In budding yeast, genetic evidence suggests that the SAE2
CC   protein is essential for the processing of hairpin DNA
CC   intermediates and meiotic double-strand breaks by Mre11/Rad50

CC   The high selenium content of SelP suggests that it may be
CC   involved in selenium intercellular transport or storage [2]. The
CC   promoter structure of bovine SelP suggest that it may be
CC   involved in countering heavy metal intoxication, and may also
CC   have a developmental function [3]. The N terminal region always
CC   contains one Sec residue, and this is separated from the C
CC   terminal region (9-16 sec residues) by a histidine-rich sequence
CC   [2].	The large number of Sec residues in the C-terminal portion

CC   have a developmental function [3]. The N-terminal region of SelP
CC   can exist independently of the C terminal region.  Zebrafish
CC   selenoprotein Pb (Swiss:Q98SV0) lacks the C terminal Sec-rich
CC   region, and a protein encoded by the rat SelP gene and lacking
CC   this region has also been reported [2]. N-terminal region
CC   contains a conserved SecxxCys motif, which is similar to the
CC   CysxxCys found in thioredoxins.  It is speculated that the N
CC   terminal region may adopt a thioredoxin fold and catalyse redox
CC   reactions [2]. The N-terminal region also contains a His-rich
CC   region, which is thought to mediate heparin binding.	Binding to

DE   SelR domain
CC   Methionine sulfoxide reduction is an important process, by which
CC   cells regulate biological processes and cope with oxidative
CC   stress. MsrA, a protein involved in the reduction of methionine
CC   sulfoxides in proteins, has been known for four decades and has
CC   been extensively characterised with respect to structure and
CC   function. However, recent studies revealed that MsrA is only
CC   specific for methionine-S-sulfoxides. Because oxidised
CC   methionines occur in a mixture of R and S isomers in vivo, it
CC   was unclear how stereo-specific MsrA could be responsible for
CC   the reduction of all protein methionine sulfoxides. It appears
CC   that a second methionine sulfoxide reductase, SelR , evolved
CC   that is specific for methionine-R-sulfoxides, the activity that
CC   is different but complementary to that of MsrA. Thus, these
CC   proteins, working together, could reduce both stereoisomers of
CC   methionine sulfoxide. This domain is found both in SelR proteins
CC   and fused with the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase
CC   enzymatic domain Pfam:PF01625. The domain has two conserved

CC   This domain is proximal to DNA in the promoter/holoenzyme
CC   complex.  Furthermore this region contains a putative
CC   helix-turn-helix motif.  At the C-terminus, there is a highly
CC   conserved region known as the RpoN box and is the signature of
CC   the sigma-54 proteins [1]. 
AC   PF07638.5
DE   ECF sigma factor
CC   These proteins are probably RNA polymerase sigma factors
CC   belonging to the extra-cytoplasmic function (ECF) subfamily [1]
CC   and show sequence similarity to Pfam:PF04542 and Pfam:PF04545.
AC   PF04546.7
DE   Sigma-70, non-essential region
CC   The domain is found in the primary vegetative sigma factor.  The
CC   function of this domain is unclear and can be removed without
CC   loss of function.

DE   Sigma-70 factor, region 1.1
CC   Region 1.1 modulates DNA binding by region 2 and 4 when sigma is
CC   unbound by the core RNA polymerase [1,2]. Region 1.1 is also
CC   involved in promoter binding [1]

AC   PF04542.8
DE   Sigma-70 region 2 
CC   Region 2 of sigma-70 is the most conserved region of the entire
CC   protein.  All members of this class of sigma-factor contain
CC   region 2. The high conservation is due to region 2 containing
CC   both the -10 promoter recognition helix and the primary core RNA
CC   polymerase binding determinant.  The core binding helix,
CC   interacts with the  clamp domain of the largest polymerase
CC   subunit, beta prime [1,2]. The aromatic residues of the
CC   recognition helix, found at the C-terminus of this domain are
CC   though to mediate strand separation, thereby allowing
CC   transcription initiation [1,2]. 
AC   PF04539.10
DE   Sigma-70 region 3
CC   Region 3 forms a discrete compact three helical domain within
CC   the sigma-factor.  Region is not normally involved in the
CC   recognition of promoter DNA, but as some specific bacterial
CC   promoters containing an extended -10 promoter element, residues
CC   within region 3 play an important role.  Region 3 primarily is
CC   involved in binding the core RNA polymerase in the holoenzyme
CC   [1].
AC   PF04545.10
DE   Sigma-70, region 4
CC   Region 4 of sigma-70 like sigma-factors are involved in binding
CC   to the -35 promoter element via a helix-turn-helix motif [1].
CC   Due to the way Pfam works, the threshold has been set
CC   artificially high to prevent overlaps with other
CC   helix-turn-helix families. Therefore there are many false
CC   negatives.
AC   PF08281.6

DE   Sigma 1s protein
CC   The reoviral gene S1 encodes for haemagglutinin (sigma 1
CC   protein), an outer capsid protein and a major factor in
CC   determining virus-host cell interactions. Sigma 1s is one of two
CC   translation products of the S1 gene.
AC   PF03084.8
DE   Reoviral Sigma1/Sigma2 family
CC   Reoviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses. They lack a membrane
CC   envelope and their capsid is organised in two concentric
CC   icosahedral layers: an inner core and an outer capsid layer. The
CC   sigma1 protein is found in the outer capsid, and the sigma2
CC   protein is found in the core. There are four other kinds of
CC   protein (besides sigma2) in the core, termed lambda 1-3, mu2.
CC   Interactions between sigma2 and lambda 1 and lambda 3 are
CC   thought to initiate core formation, followed by mu2 and lambda2
CC   [5]. Sigma1 is a trimeric protein, and is positioned at the 12
CC   vertices of the icosahedral outer capsid layer. Its N-terminal
CC   fibrous tail, arranged as a triple coiled coil, anchors it in
CC   the virion, and a C-terminal globular head interacts with the
CC   cellular receptor [2].  These two parts form by separate
CC   trimerisation events. The N-terminal fibrous tail forms on the
CC   polysome, without the involvement of ATP or chaperones. The
CC   post- translational assembly of the C-terminal globular head
CC   involves the chaperone activity of Hsp90, which is associated
CC   with	phosphorylation of Hsp90 during the process [2]. Sigma1
CC   protein acts as a cell attachment protein, and determines viral
CC   virulence, pathways of spread, and tropism. Junctional adhesion
CC   molecule has been identified as a receptor for sigma1 [1]. In
CC   type 3  reoviruses, a small region, predicted to form a beta
CC   sheet, in the N-terminal tail was found to bind target cell
CC   surface sialic acid (i.e. sialic acid acts as a co-receptor) and
CC   promote apoptosis [4]. The sigma1 protein also binds to the
CC   lambda2 core protein [3].

DE   Protein of unknown function (DUF541)
CC   Members of this family have so far been found in bacteria and
CC   mouse SwissProt or TrEMBL entries.  However possible family
CC   members have also been identified in translated rat
CC   (Genbank:AW144450) and human (Genbank:AI478629) ESTs. A mouse
CC   family member has been named SIMPL (signalling molecule that
CC   associates with mouse pelle-like kinase).  SIMPL appears to
CC   facilitate and/or regulate complex formation between IRAK/mPLK
CC   (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and IKK (inhibitor of kappa-B
CC   kinase) containing complexes, and thus regulate NF-kappa-B
CC   activity [1]. Separate experiments demonstrate that a mouse
CC   family member (named LaXp180) binds the Listeria monocytogenes
CC   surface protein ActA, which is a virulence factor that induces
CC   actin polymerisation. It may also bind stathmin, a protein
CC   involved in signal transduction and in the regulation of
CC   microtubule dynamics [2]. In bacteria its function is unknown,
CC   but it is thought to be located in the periplasm or outer
CC   membrane.
AC   PF06621.6
DE   Single-minded protein C-terminus
CC   This family represents the C-terminal region of the eukaryotic
CC   single-minded (SIM) protein. Drosophila single-minded acts as a
CC   positive master gene regulator in central nervous system midline
CC   formation. There are two homologues in mammals: SIM1 and SIM2,
CC   which are members of the basic-helix-loop-helix PAS family of
CC   transcription factors. SIM1 and SIM2 are novel
CC   heterodimerisation partners for ARNT in vitro, and they may
CC   function both as positive and negative transcriptional
CC   regulators in vivo, during embryogenesis and in the adult
CC   organism [1]. SIM2 is thought to contribute to some specific
CC   Down syndrome phenotypes [2]. This family is found in
CC   conjunction with a Pfam:PF00989 domain and associated
CC   Pfam:PF00785 motif.
AC   PF05422.6
DE   Stress-activated map kinase interacting protein 1 (SIN1)
CC   This family consists of several stress-activated map kinase
CC   interacting protein 1 (MAPKAP1 OR SIN1) sequences. The fission
CC   yeast Sty1/Spc1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is a
CC   member of the eukaryotic stress-activated MAP kinase (SAPK)
CC   family. Sin1 interacts with Sty1/Spc1. Cells lacking Sin1
CC   display many, but not all, of the phenotypes of cells lacking
CC   the Sty1/Spc1 MAP kinase including sterility, multiple stress
CC   sensitivity and a cell-cycle delay. Sin1 is phosphorylated after
CC   stress but this is not Sty1/Spc1-dependent [1]. 
AC   PF03145.10
DE   Seven in absentia protein family
CC   The seven in absentia (sina) gene was first identified in
CC   Drosophila. The Drosophila Sina protein is essential for the
CC   determination of the R7 pathway in photoreceptor cell
CC   development: the loss of functional Sina results in the
CC   transformation of the R7 precursor cell to a non- neuronal cell
CC   type. The Sina protein contains an N-terminal RING finger domain
CC   Pfam:PF00097. Through this domain, Sina binds E2
CC   ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UbcD1) Sina also interacts with
CC   Tramtrack (TTK88) via PHYL. Tramtrack is a transcriptional
CC   repressor that blocks photoreceptor determination, while PHYL
CC   down-regulates the activity of TTK88. In turn, the activity of
CC   PHYL requires the activation of the Sevenless receptor tyrosine
CC   kinase, a process essential for R7 determination. It is thought
CC   that thus Sina targets TTK88 for degradation, therefore
CC   promoting the R7 pathway. Murine and human homologues of Sina
CC   have also been identified. The human homologue Siah-1 [1] also
CC   binds E2 enzymes (UbcH5) and through a series of physical
CC   interactions, targets beta-catenin for ubiquitin degradation.
CC   Siah-1 expression is enhanced by p53, itself promoted by DNA
CC   damage. Thus this pathway links DNA damage to beta-catenin
CC   degradation [2,3]. Sina proteins, therefore, physically interact
CC   with a variety of proteins. The N-terminal RING finger domain
CC   that binds ubiquitin conjugating enzymes is described in
CC   Pfam:PF00097, and does not form part of the alignment for this
CC   family. The remainder C-terminal part is involved in
CC   interactions with other proteins, and is included in this
CC   alignment. In addition to the Drosophila protein and mammalian
CC   homologues, whose similarity was noted previously, this family
CC   also includes putative homologues from Caenorhabditis elegans,
CC   Arabidopsis thaliana.
AC   PF08671.4
DE   Anti-repressor SinI
CC   SinR is a pleiotropic regulator of several late growth
CC   processes. It is a tetrameric DNA binding protein whose activity
CC   is down-regulated thorough the formation of a SinI:SinR protein
CC   complex.  When complexed with SinI, the SinR tetramer is
CC   disrupted such that is no longer able to bind DNA.
AC   PF04801.7
DE   Sin-like protein conserved region
CC   Family of higher eukaryotic proteins.  SIN was identified as a
CC   protein that interacts specifically with SXL (sex lethal) in a

CC   is linked to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic
CC   lateral sclerosis(ALS) in humans[1].
AC   PF09052.4
DE   Salmonella invasion protein A
CC   Salmonella invasion protein A is an actin-binding protein that
CC   contributes to host cytoskeletal rearrangements by stimulating
CC   actin polymerisation and counteracting F-actin destabilising
CC   proteins. Members of this family possess an all-helical fold
CC   consisting of eight alpha-helices arranged so that six long,
CC   amphipathic helices form a compact fold that surrounds a final,
CC   predominantly hydrophobic helix in the middle of the molecule
CC   [1].

CC   Sir1p interacts with the BAH domain of the Orc1p subunit of the
CC   origin recognition complex (ORC) resulting in the establishment
CC   of silent chromatin at HMR and HML in S.cerevisiae [1]. The
CC   amino acids from the ORC interaction region of Sir1p are

CC   that depend on nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD). They are
CC   found in many subcellular locations, including the nucleus,
CC   cytoplasm and mitochondria. Eukaryotic forms play in important
CC   role in the regulation of transcriptional repression. Moreover,

DE   Cd27 binding protein (Siva)
CC   Siva binds to the CD27 cytoplasmic tail. It has a DD homology
CC   region, a box-B-like ring finger, and a zinc finger-like domain.
CC   Overexpression of Siva in various cell lines induces apoptosis,
CC   suggesting an important role for Siva in the CD27-transduced
CC   apoptotic pathway [1]. Siva-1 binds to and inhibits
CC   BCL-X(L)-mediated protection against UV radiation-induced
CC   apoptosis. Indeed, the unique amphipathic helical region (SAH)
CC   present in Siva-1 is required for its binding to BCL-X(L) and
CC   sensitising cells to UV radiation. Natural complexes of
CC   Siva-1/BCL-X(L) are detected in HUT78 and murine thymocyte,
CC   suggesting a potential role for Siva-1 in regulating T cell
CC   homeostasis [2]. This family contains both Siva-1 and the

CC   motif. The c-ski proto-oncogene has been shown to influence
CC   proliferation, morphological transformation and myogenic
CC   differentiation [1]. Sno, a Ski proto-oncogene homologue, is

CC   Members of this family assume a beta-gamma-crystallin fold,
CC   wherein nine beta-strands are connected by loop, and are
CC   separated into two sheets, each sheet forming the Greek key
CC   motif. The two Greek key motifs face each other in the global
CC   topology. The three-dimensional structure of the molecule is a
CC   'sandwich'-shaped beta-barrel structure: hydrophobic side-chains
CC   are packed in the large interface area of the beta-sheets. This
CC   domain confers a cytocidal effect to the toxin, causing cell
CC   death in both budding and fission yeasts, and morphological
CC   changes in yeasts and filamentous fungi [1].

CC   beta1,3-glucan, and chitin. It has been postulated that the
CC   synthesis of beta1,6-glucan begins in the endoplasmic reticulum
CC   with the formation of protein-bound primer structures and that
CC   these primer structures are extended in the Golgi complex by two

DE   Soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen (SLA/LP autoantigen)
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic and archaeal proteins

DE   Pre-mRNA splicing Prp18-interacting factor
CC   The spliceosome, an assembly of snRNAs (U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5)
CC   and proteins, catalyses the excision of introns from pre-mRNAs
CC   in two successive trans-esterification reactions. Step 2 depends
CC   upon integral spliceosome constituents such as U5 snRNA and Prp8
CC   and non-spliceosomal proteins Prp16, Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22. ATP
CC   hydrolysis by the DEAH-box enzyme Prp16 promotes a
CC   conformational change in the spliceosome that leads to
CC   protection of the 3'ss from targeted RNase H cleavage. This
CC   change, which probably reflects binding of the 3'ss PyAG in the
CC   catalytic centre of the spliceosome, requires the ordered
CC   recruitment of Slu7, Prp18, and Prp22 to the spliceosome. There
CC   is a close functional relationship between Prp8, Prp18, and
CC   Slu7, and Prp18 interacts with Slu7, so that together they
CC   recruit Prp22 to the spliceosome. Most members of the family

AC   PF03357.15
DE   Snf7
CC   This family of proteins are involved in protein sorting and
CC   transport from the endosome to the vacuole/lysosome in
CC   eukaryotic cells. Vacuoles/lysosomes play an important role in
CC   the degradation of both lipids and cellular proteins. In order
CC   to perform this degradative function, vacuoles/lysosomes contain
CC   numerous hydrolases which have been transported in the form of
CC   inactive precursors via the biosynthetic pathway and are
CC   proteolytically activated upon delivery to the vacuole/lysosome.
CC   The delivery of transmembrane proteins, such as activated cell
CC   surface receptors to the lumen of the vacuole/lysosome, either
CC   for degradation/downregulation, or in the case of hydrolases,
CC   for proper localisation, requires the formation of
CC   multivesicular bodies (MVBs).  These late endosomal structures
CC   are formed by invaginating and budding of the limiting membrane
CC   into the lumen of the compartment. During this process, a subset
CC   of the endosomal membrane proteins is sorted into the forming
CC   vesicles. Mature MVBs fuse with the vacuole/lysosome, thereby
CC   releasing cargo containing vesicles into its hydrolytic lumen
CC   for degradation. Endosomal proteins that are not sorted into the
CC   intralumenal MVB vesicles are either recycled back to the plasma
CC   membrane or Golgi complex, or remain in the limiting membrane of
CC   the MVB and are thereby transported to the limiting membrane of
CC   the vacuole/lysosome as a consequence of fusion. Therefore, the
CC   MVB sorting pathway plays a critical role in the decision
CC   between recycling and degradation of membrane proteins [1]. A
CC   few archaeal sequences are also present within this family.

DE   Spectrin repeat
CC   Spectrin repeat-domains are found in several proteins involved
CC   in cytoskeletal structure.  These include spectrin,

CC   are defined by a characteristic tryptophan (W) residue at
CC   position 17 in helix A and a leucine (L) at 2 residues from the
CC   carboxyl end of helix C. Although the domain occurs in ultiple
CC   repeats along sequences, the domains are actually stable on

DE   Entomopoxvirus spheroidin protein
CC   Entomopoxviruses (EPVs) are large (300-400 nm) oval-shaped
CC   viruses replicating in the cytoplasm of their insect host cells.
CC   At the end of their replicative cycle EPVs virions are occluded
CC   in a highly expressed protein called spheroidin. This protein
CC   forms large (5-20 mm long) oval-shaped occlusion bodies (OBs)
CC   called spherules. The infectious cycle of EPVs begins with the
CC   ingestion by the insect host of the spherules, their dissolution
CC   by the alkaline reducing conditions of the midgut fluid and the
CC   release of virions in the midgut lumen. The infective particles
CC   first replicate in midgut epithelial cells, then pass the gut
CC   barrier to colonise the internal tissues, mainly the fat body
CC   cells. Whilst spheroidin has been demonstrated to be
CC   non-essential for viral replication, it plays an essential role
CC   in the natural biological cycle of the virus in protecting
CC   virions from adverse environmental conditions (e.g. UV
CC   degradation) and thus improving transmission efficacy. In this
CC   respect, spheroidins are functionally similar to polyhedrins of
CC   baculoviruses or cypoviruses [1].

DE   Spherulation-specific family 4
CC   This protein is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.
CC   Proteins in this family are typically between 250 and 398 amino
CC   acids in length.  There is a conserved NPG sequence motif and
CC   there are two completely conserved G residues that may be
CC   functionally important. Starvation will often induce
CC   spherulation - the production of spores - and this process may
CC   involve DNA-methylation. Changes in the methylation of
CC   spherulin4 are associated with the formation of spherules, but
CC   these changes are probably transient. Methylation of the gene
CC   accompanies its transcriptional activation, and spherulin4 mRNA
CC   is only detectable in late spherulating cultures and mature
CC   spherules. It is a spherulation-specific protein.

CC   endospore formation. The operon is regulated by sigmaG [1].
AC   PF12685.1
DE   SpoIIIAH-like protein
CC   Stage III sporulation protein AH (SpoIIIAH) is a protein that is
CC   involved in forespore engulfment. It forms a channel with
CC   SpoIIIAH that is open on the forespore end and closed (or gated)
CC   on the mother cell end. This allows sigma-E-directed gene
CC   expression in the mother-cell compartment of the sporangium to
CC   trigger the activation of sigma-G forespore-specific gene
CC   expression by a pathway of intercellular signaling.  This family
CC   of proteins is found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes and so
CC   must have a wider function that in sporulation.  Proteins in

DE   Stage III sporulation protein D

CC   conserved RGG sequence motif.
AC   PF07454.5
DE   Stage II sporulation protein P (SpoIIP)
CC   This family contains the bacterial stage II sporulation protein
CC   P (SpoIIP) (approximately 350 residues long). It has been shown
CC   that a block in polar cytokinesis in Bacillus subtilis is
CC   mediated partly by transcription of spoIID, spoIIM and spoIIP.
CC   This inhibition of polar division is involved in the locking in
CC   of asymmetry after the formation of a polar septum during
CC   sporulation [1]. Engulfment in Bacillus subtilis is mediated by
CC   two complementary systems: the first includes the proteins
CC   SpoIID, SpoIIM and SpoIIP (DMP) which carry out the engulfment,
CC   and the second includes the SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAGH (Q-AH) zipper, that
CC   recruits other proteins to the septum in a second-phase of the
CC   engulfment. The course of events follows as the incorporation
CC   firstly of SpoIIB into the septum during division to serve
CC   directly or indirectly as a landmark for localising SpoIIM and
CC   then SpoIIP and SpoIID to the septum. SpoIIP and SpoIID interact
CC   together to form part of the DMP complex [3]. SpoIIP itself has
CC   been identified as an autolysin with peptidoglycan hydrolase
CC   activity [2].

CC   signals result in sensor kinase activation and phosphorylation
CC   of the master sporulation response regulator Spo0A. 
CC   Phosphatases such as Spo0E dephosphorylate Spo0A thereby
CC   inhibiting sporulation.  This is a family of Spo0E-like
CC   phosphatases.  The structure of a Bacillus anthracis member of

CC   peptidoglycan [1]. Two tandem repeats fold into a pseudo-2-fold
CC   symmetric single-domain structure containing numerous contacts
CC   between the repeats [1]. FtsN is an essential cell division
CC   protein with a simple bitopic topology, a short N-terminal
CC   cytoplasmic segment fused to a large carboxy periplasmic domain
CC   through a single transmembrane domain. These repeats lay at the

CC   and SpoVG.  SpoVS seems to play a positive role in allowing
CC   progression beyond stage V of sporulation.  Null mutations in
CC   the spoVS gene block sporulation at stage V, impairing the
CC   development of heat resistance and coat assembly [1].

DE   SpoVT / AbrB like domain
CC   One member of this family is AbrB from Bacillus subtilis.	  
CC 	    The product of the abrB gene is an ambiactive
CC   repressor and activator or the transcription of genes expressed
CC   during the transition state between vegetative growth and the
CC   onset of stationary phase and sporulation [3]. AbrB is thought
CC   to interact directly with the transcription initiation regions
CC   of genes under its control [1]. AbrB contains a helix-turn-helix
CC   structure, but this domain ends before the helix-turn-helix
CC   begins [2]. The product of the Bacillus subtilis gene spoVT is
CC   another member of this family and is also a transcriptional
CC   regulator [5]. DNA binding activity in the Bacillus 0 AbrB
CC   homologue requires hexamerisation [4]. Another family member has
CC   been isolated from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus and has
CC   been identified as a homologue of bacterial repressor-like
CC   proteins. The E.coli family member SohA or Prl1F appears to be
CC   bifunctional and is able to regulate its own expression as well
CC   as relieve the export block imposed by high-level synthesis of
CC   beta-galactosidase hybrid proteins [6].

DE   Secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24)
CC   This family represents a conserved region approximately 140
CC   residues long within secreted phosphoprotein 24 (Spp-24), which
CC   seems to be restricted to vertebrates. This is a non-collagenous
CC   protein found in bone that is related in sequence to the
CC   cystatin family of thiol protease inhibitors. This suggests that
CC   Spp-24 could function to modulate the thiol protease activities
CC   known to be involved in bone turnover. It is also possible that
CC   the intact form of Spp-24 found in bone could be a precursor to
CC   a biologically active peptide that coordinates an aspect of bone
CC   turnover [1].

DE   Sprouty protein (Spry)
CC   This family consists of eukaryotic Sprouty protein homologues.
CC   Sprouty proteins have been revealed as inhibitors of the
CC   Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, a pathway
CC   crucial for developmental processes initiated by activation of
CC   various receptor tyrosine kinases [1]. The sprouty gene has

CC   This presumed domain is found in the Spt20 proteins from both
CC   human and yeast.  The Spt20 protein is part of the SAGA complex
CC   which is a large cmplex mediating histone deacetylation. Yeast
CC   Spt20 has been shown to play a role in structural integrity of

CC   deletion strains.
AC   PF06093.7
DE   Spt4/RpoE2 zinc finger
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic transcription
CC   elongation Spt4 proteins as well as archaebacterial RpoE2 [2].
CC   Three transcription-elongation factors Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 are
CC   conserved among eukaryotes and are essential for transcription
CC   via the modulation of chromatin structure. Spt4 and Spt5 are
CC   tightly associated in a complex, while the physical association
CC   of the Spt4-Spt5 complex with Spt6 is considerably weaker. It
CC   has been demonstrated that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 play roles in
CC   transcription elongation in both yeast and humans including a
CC   role in activation by Tat. It is known that Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6
CC   are general transcription-elongation factors, controlling
CC   transcription both positively and negatively in important
CC   regulatory and developmental roles [1].  RpoE2 is one of 13
CC   subunits in the archaeal RNA polymerase. These proteins contain
CC   a C4-type zinc finger, and the structure has been solved in [3].
CC   The structure reveals that Spt4-Spt5 binding is governed by an
CC   acid-dipole interaction between Spt5 and Spt4, and the complex
CC   binds to and travels along the elongating RNA polymerase. The
CC   Spt4-Spt5 complex is likely to be an ancient, core component of
CC   the transcription elongation machinery.

DE   Early transcription elongation factor of RNA pol II, NGN section
CC   Spt5p and prokaryotic NusG are shown to contain a novel 'NGN'
CC   domain. The combined NGN and KOW motif regions of Spt5 form the
CC   binding domain with Spt4 [1].  Spt5 complexes with Spt4 as a 1:1
CC   heterodimer snf this Spt5-Spt4 complex regulates early
CC   transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II and has an imputed
CC   role in pre-mRNA processing via its physical association with
CC   mRNA capping enzymes. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe core
CC   Spt5-Spt4 complex is a heterodimer bearing a trypsin-resistant

DE   Spt5 transcription elongation factor, acidic N-terminal
CC   This is the very acidic N-terminal region of the early
CC   transcription elongation factor Spt5 [1]. The Spt5-Spt4 complex
CC   regulates early transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II
CC   and has an imputed role in pre-mRNA processing via its physical
CC   association with mRNA capping enzymes. The actual function of
CC   this N-terminal domain is not known although it is dispensable
CC   for binding to Spt4 [2].

DE   SPX domain
CC   We have named this region the SPX domain after (SYG1, Pho81 and
CC   XPR1). This 180 residue length domain is found at the amino
CC   terminus of a variety of proteins. In the yeast protein SYG1,
CC   the N-terminus directly binds to the G- protein beta subunit and
CC   inhibits transduction of the mating pheromone signal [3]. This
CC   finding suggests that all the members of this family are
CC   involved in G-protein associated signal transduction. The
CC   N-termini of several proteins involved in the regulation of
CC   phosphate transport, including the putative phosphate level
CC   sensors PHO81 Swiss:P17442 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
CC   NUC-2 Swiss:Q01317 from Neurospora crassa, are also members of
CC   this family [see 4,5].  The SPX domain of S. cerevisiae
CC   low-affinity phosphate transporters Pho87 and Pho90
CC   auto-regulates uptake and prevents efflux. This SPX dependent
CC   inhibition is mediated by the physical interaction with Spl2 [6]
CC   NUC-2 contains several ankyrin repeats Pfam:PF00023. Several
CC   members of this family are annotated as XPR1 proteins: the
CC   xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor confers
CC   susceptibility to infection with murine leukaemia viruses (MLV)
CC   [1].	The similarity between SYG1, phosphate regulators and XPR1
CC   sequences has been previously noted, as has the additional
CC   similarity to several predicted proteins, of unknown function,
CC   from Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana,
CC   Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and
CC   Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1,2]. In addition, given the
CC   similarities between XPR1 and SYG1 and phosphate regulatory
CC   proteins, it has been proposed that XPR1 might be involved in
CC   G-protein associated signal transduction and may itself function
CC   as a phosphate sensor [1].

DE   Cell cycle regulatory protein
CC   Speedy (Spy1) is a cell cycle regulatory protein which activates
CC   CDK2, the major kinase that allows progression through G1/S
CC   phase and further replication events [1]. Spy1 expression
CC   overcomes a p27-induced cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA
CC   synthesis, so cell cycle progression occurs due to an
CC   interaction between Spy1 and p27 [1]. Spy1 is also known as
CC   Ringo protein A.

DE   Surfactant protein C, N terminal propeptide
CC   The N-terminal propeptide of surfactant protein C adopts an
CC   alpha-helical structure, with turn and extended regions. It's
CC   main function is the stabilisation of metastable surfactant
CC   protein C (SP-C), since the latter can irreversibly transform
CC   from its native alpha-helical structure to beta-sheet aggregates
CC   and form amyloid-like fibrils. The correct intracellular
CC   trafficking of proSP-C has also been reported to depend on the
CC   propeptide [1].

CC   SR-25, otherwise known as ADP-ribosylation factor-like factor
CC   6-interacting protein 4, is expressed in virtually all tissues.
CC   At the N-terminus there is a repeat of serine-arginine (SR
CC   repeat), and towards the middle of the protein there are
CC   clusters of both serines and of basic amino acids. The presence
CC   of many nuclear localisation signals strongly implies that this
CC   is a nuclear protein that may contribute to RNA splicing [1].
CC   SR-25 is also implicated, along with heat-shock-protein-27, as a
CC   mediator in the Rac1 (GTPase ras-related C3 botulinum toxin
CC   substrate 1) signalling pathway [2].

DE   C. elegans Sre G protein-coupled chemoreceptor
CC   Caenorhabditis elegans Sre proteins are candidate chemosensory

CC   Pfam:PF02117 and Srb Pfam:PF02175 comprise the Sra group. All of
CC   the above receptors are thought to be G protein-coupled seven
CC   transmembrane domain proteins [1,2]. The existence of several
CC   different chemosensory receptors underlies the fact that in
CC   spite of having only 20-30 chemosensory neurones, C. elegans

CC   second helices are antiparallel to each other and are of similar
CC   length; the third helix, which is packed across helices alpha1
CC   and alpha2 is slightly shorter, consisting of only 15 amino
CC   acids. Most conserved hydrophobic residues are largely buried in
CC   the interior of the structure and form an extensive and
CC   contiguous hydrophobic core that stabilises the packing of the

DE   Stringent starvation protein B
CC   Escherichia coli stringent starvation protein B (SspB), is
CC   thought to enhance the specificity of degradation of
CC   tmRNA-tagged proteins by the ClpXP protease.	The tmRNA tag,
CC   also known as ssrA, is an 11-aa peptide added to the C terminus
CC   of proteins stalled during translation, targets proteins for
CC   degradation by ClpXP and ClpAP.  SspB a cytoplasmic protein that
CC   specifically binds to residues 1-4 and 7 of the tag. Binding of
CC   SspB enhances degradation of tagged proteins by ClpX, and masks
CC   sequence elements important for ClpA interactions, inhibiting
CC   degradation by ClpA [1]. However, more recent work has cast
CC   doubt on the importance of SspB in wild-type cells [2]. SspB is
CC   encoded in an operon whose synthesis is stimulated by carbon,
CC   amino acid, and phosphate starvation.  SspB may play a special
CC   role during nutrient stress, for example by ensuring rapid

CC   The sspO is the first gene in a likely operon with sspP and 
CC   transcription of this gene is primarily by RNA polymerase with

CC   the N-terminus. However, from the analysis of these deletion
CC   constructs further repression activity was found at the

CC   for signalling through the mating response MAPK pathway. Ste5
CC   has separate binding sites for each member of the MAPK cascade.
CC   This region of Ste5 allosterically activates autophosphroylation

DE   Sterol-sensing domain of SREBP cleavage-activation
CC   Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are
CC   membrane-bound transcription factors that promote lipid
CC   synthesis in animal cells. They are embedded in the membranes of
CC   the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a helical hairpin orientation
CC   and are released from the ER by a two-step proteolytic process.
CC   Proteolysis begins when the SREBPs are cleaved at Site-1, which
CC   is located at a leucine residue in the middle of the hydrophobic
CC   loop in the lumen of the ER [1]. Upon proteolytic processing
CC   SREBP can activate the expression of genes involved in

CC   Ser/Thr protein kinase, that has Mn2+-dependent protein kinase
CC   activity that phosphorylates alpha -casein at Ser/Thr residues
CC   and histone at Ser residues. It can be covalently modified by
CC   the reactive ATP analogue 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine in

DE   Telomere capping C-terminal wHTH
CC   This domain consists of tandem winged helix-turn-helix motifs.
CC   Stn1 and Ten1 are DNA-binding proteins with specificity for
CC   telomeric DNA substrates and both protect chromosome termini
CC   from unregulated resection and regulate telomere length. Stn1
CC   complexes with Ten1 and Cdc13 to function as a telomere-specific
CC   replication protein A (RPA)-like complex [1]. These three
CC   interacting proteins associate with the telomeric overhang in
CC   budding yeast, whereas a single protein known as Pot1
CC   (protection of telomeres-1) performs this function in fission
CC   yeast, and a two-subunit complex consisting of POT1 and TPP1
CC   associates with telomeric ssDNA in humans. S.pombe has Stn1- and
CC   Ten1-like proteins that are essential for chromosome end
CC   protection. Stn1 orthologues exist in all species that have
CC   Pot1, whereas Ten1-like proteins can be found in all fungi.
CC   Fission yeast Stn1 and Ten1 localise at telomeres in a manner
CC   that correlates with the length of the ssDNA overhang,
CC   suggesting that they specifically associate with the telomeric
CC   ssDNA. Two separate protein complexes are required for

CC   the Gli and Ci transcription factors of the Hedgehog signalling
CC   cascade. It functions by binding these proteins and preventing
CC   their translocation to the nucleus. The C terminal domain is
CC   only found in eukaryotic Su(fu) proteins; it is not present in

DE   Synaphin protein
CC   This family consists of several eukaryotic synaphin 1 and 2
CC   proteins. Synaphin/complexin is a cytosolic protein that

CC   Synaphin promotes SNAREs to form precomplexes that oligomerise
CC   into higher order structures. A peptide from the central,
CC   syntaxin binding domain of synaphin competitively inhibits these
CC   two proteins from interacting and prevents SNARE complexes from
CC   oligomerising. It is thought that oligomerisation of SNARE
CC   complexes into a higher order structure creates a SNARE scaffold
CC   for efficient, regulated fusion of synaptic vesicles [1].

DE   Syntaxin
CC   Syntaxins are the prototype family of SNARE proteins. They
CC   usually consist of three main regions - a C-terminal
CC   transmembrane region, a central SNARE domain which is
CC   characteristic of and conserved in all syntaxins (Pfam:PF05739),
CC   and an N-terminal domain that is featured in this entry. This
CC   domain varies between syntaxin isoforms; in syntaxin 1A
CC   (Swiss:O35526) it is found as three alpha-helices with a
CC   left-handed twist. It may fold back on the SNARE domain to allow
CC   the molecule to adopt a 'closed' configuration that prevents
CC   formation of the core fusion complex - it thus has an
CC   auto-inhibitory role. The function of syntaxins is determined by
CC   their localisation. They are involved in neuronal exocytosis,
CC   ER-Golgi transport and Golgi-endosome transport, for example.
CC   They also interact with other proteins as well as those involved

DE   T4 bacteriophage base plate protein
CC   This protein is found in viruses. Proteins in this family are
CC   typically between 208 to 249 amino acids in length. This protein
CC   has a single completely conserved residue S that may be
CC   functionally important. This family includes the two base plate
CC   proteins in T4 bacteriophages. These are gp51 and gp26, encoded

DE   Bacteriophage T4 gp9/10-like protein
CC   The members of this family are similar to gene products 9 (gp9)
CC   and 10 (gp10) of bacteriophage T4. Both proteins are components
CC   of the viral baseplate [1]. Gp9 (Swiss:P10927) connects the long
CC   tail fibres of the virus to the baseplate and triggers tail
CC   contraction after viral attachment to a host cell. The protein
CC   is active as a trimer, with each monomer being composed of three
CC   domains.  The N-terminal domain consists of an extended
CC   polypeptide chain and two alpha helices. The alpha1 helix from
CC   each of the three monomers in the trimer interacts with its
CC   counterparts to form a coiled-coil structure. The middle domain
CC   is a seven-stranded beta-sandwich that is thought to be a novel
CC   protein fold. The C-terminal domain is thought to be essential
CC   for gp9 trimerisation and is organised into an eight- stranded
CC   antiparallel beta-barrel, which was found to resemble the 'jelly
CC   roll' fold found in many viral capsid proteins. The long
CC   flexible region between the N-terminal and middle domains may be
CC   required for the function of gp9 to transmit signals from the
CC   long tail fibres [2]. Together with gp11, gp10 (Swiss:P10928)
CC   initiates the assembly of wedges that then go on to associate
CC   with a hub to form the viral baseplate [1].

DE   Virus neck protein
CC   This family of protein represents gene product 14, a major
CC   component of the neck in T4-like viruses along with gene product

CC   attachment [1].

DE   Type VI secretion lipoprotein
CC   One of the virulence mechanisms of E coli is the production of
CC   toxins which it produces from dedicated machineries called
CC   secretion systems. Seven secretion systems have been described,
CC   which assemble from 3 to upto more than 20 subunits. These
CC   secretion systems derive from or have co-evolved with bacterial
CC   organelles such as ABC transporters (type I), type IV pili (type
CC   2), flagella (type 3), or conjugative machines (type IV). The
CC   type VI secretion system (T6SS) is present in most pathogens
CC   that have contact with animals, plants, or humans. SciN is a
CC   lipoprotein tethered to the outer membrane and expressed in the
CC   periplasm of E coli and is essential for T6S-dependent secretion
CC   of the Hcp-like SciD protein and for biofilm formation.

CC   various bacterial species, the tad locus is closely  linked to
CC   flp-like genes, which encode proteins required  for the
CC   production of pili involved in adherence to  surfaces [1]. It is
CC   thought that the tad loci encode  proteins that act to assemble

DE   Thin aggregative fimbriae synthesis protein
CC   Fimbriae are cell-surface protein polymers, of eg. E coli and
CC   Salmonella spp, that mediate interactions important for host and
CC   environmental persistence, development of biofilms, motility,
CC   colonisation and invasion of cells, and conjugation. Four
CC   general assembly pathways for different fimbriae have been
CC   proposed, one of which is extracellular nucleation-precipitation
CC   (ENP), that differs from the others in that fibre-growth occurs
CC   extracellularly. Thin aggregative fimbriae (Tafi) are the only
CC   fimbriae dependent on the ENP pathway. Tafi were first
CC   identified in Salmonella spp and the controlling operon termed
CC   agf; however subsequent isolation of the homologous operon in E
CC   coli led to its being called csg. Tafi are known as curli
CC   because, in the absence of extracellular polysaccharides, their
CC   morphology appears curled; however, when expressed with such
CC   polysaccharides their morphology appears as a tangled amorphous
CC   matrix. The gene agfC is found to be transcribed at low levels,
CC   localised to the periplasm in a mature form, and in combination
CC   with AgfE is important for AgfA extracellular assembly, which
CC   facilitates the synthesis of Tafi. The genes involved in Tafi
CC   production are organised into two adjacent divergently
CC   transcribed operons, agfBAC and agfDEFG, both of which are
CC   required for biosynthesis and assembly [1].
AC   PF10614.3
DE   Curli production assembly/transport component CsgF

CC   matrix [2]. CsgF is one of three putative curli assembly factors
CC   appearing to act as a nucleator protein. Unlike eukaryotic

CC   assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex.	The
CC   conserved region is found at the C-terminal of most member
CC   proteins.  The crystal structure of hTAFII28 with hTAFII18 shows

DE   Phage tail tube protein
CC   This bacterial family of proteins contains phage tail tube
CC   proteins related to the Mu phage protein Swiss:P79679 [1].
CC   Bacteriophage Mu has an eicosahedral head and contractile tail.
CC   The tail is composed of an outer sheath and an inner tube.
AC   PF09141.4
DE   Talin, middle domain
CC   Members of this family adopt a structure consisting of five
CC   alpha helices that fold into a bundle. They contain a Vinculin
CC   binding site (VBS) composed of a hydrophobic surface spanning
CC   five turns of helix four. Activation of the VBS causes
CC   subsequent recruitment of Vinculin, which enables maturation of
CC   small integrin/talin complexes into more stable adhesions.
CC   Formation of the complex between VBS and Vinculin requires prior
CC   unfolding of this middle domain: once released from the talin
CC   hydrophobic core, the VBS helix is then available to induce the
CC   'bundle conversion' conformational change within the vinculin
CC   head domain thereby displacing the intramolecular interaction
CC   with the vinculin tail, allowing vinculin to bind actin [1].
AC   PF11640.2
DE   Telomere-length maintenance and DNA damage repair
CC   ATM is a large protein kinase, in humans, critical for
CC   responding to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Tel1, the
CC   orthologue from budding yeast, also regulates responses to DSBs.
CC   Tel1 is important for maintaining viability and for
CC   phosphorylation of the DNA damage signal transducer kinase Rad53
CC   (an orthologue of mammalian CHK2). In addition to functioning in
CC   the response to DSBs, numerous findings indicate that Tel1/ATM
CC   regulates telomeres. The overall domain structure of Tel1/ATM is
CC   shared by proteins of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
CC   (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, but this family carries a
CC   unique and functionally important TAN sequence motif, near its
CC   N-terminal, LxxxKxxE/DRxxxL. which is conserved specifically in
CC   the Tel1/ATM subclass of the PIKKs. The TAN motif is essential

DE   Lambda phage tail tape-measure protein (Tape_meas_lam_C)
CC   This represents a relatively well-conserved region near the C
CC   terminus of the tape measure protein of a lambda and related
CC   phage. The protein, which controls phage tail length, is
CC   typically about 1000 residues in length. Both low-complexity
CC   sequence and insertion/deletion events appear common in this
CC   family. Mutational studies suggest a ruler or template role in
CC   the determination of phage tail length. Similar behaviour is
CC   attributed to proteins from distantly related or unrelated
CC   families in other phage.

DE   Tash protein PEST motif
CC   This motif is found in the Tash AT-hook proteins of Theileria
CC   annulata. These proteins are transported to the hosts nucleus
CC   and are likely to be involved in pathogenesis [1]. It is also

DE   Sec-independent protein translocase protein (TatC)
CC   The bacterial Tat system has a remarkable ability to transport
CC   folded proteins even enzyme complexes across the cytoplasmic

CC   Delta pH-driven thylakoidal protein import pathway. A functional
CC   Tat system or Delta pH-dependent pathway requires three integral
CC   membrane proteins: TatA/Tha4, TatB/Hcf106 and TatC/cpTatC. The
CC   TatC protein is essential for the function of both pathways. It
CC   might be involved in twin-arginine signal peptide recognition,
CC   protein translocation and proton translocation. Sequence
CC   analysis predicts that TatC contains six transmembrane helices
CC   (TMHs), and experimental data confirmed that N- and C-termini of
CC   TatC or cpTatC are exposed to the cytoplasmic or stromal face of
CC   the membrane. The cytoplasmic N-terminus and the first

CC   This family consists of several telomere-binding protein beta
CC   subunits which appear to be specific to the family Oxytrichidae.
CC   Telomeres are specialised protein-DNA complexes that compose the
CC   ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres protect chromosome
CC   termini from degradation and recombination and act together with
CC   telomerase to ensure complete genome replication. TEBP beta
CC   forms a complex with TEBP alpha and this complex is able to

DE   Tektin family
CC   Tektins are cytoskeletal proteins. They have been demonstrated

CC   protofilaments, organised as longitudinal polymers of tektin
CC   heterodimers with axial periodicity matching tubulin. Tektin
CC   polypeptides consist of several alpha-helical regions that are 
CC   predicted to form coiled coils. Indeed, tektins share
CC   considerable structural similarities with intermediate filament
CC   proteins. Possible functional roles for tektins are:

DE   Telethonin protein
CC   Telethonin is a 167-residue protein which complexes with the
CC   large muscle protein, titin. The very N-terminus of titin,
CC   composed of two immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, referred to as
CC   Z1 and Z2, interacts with the N-terminal region (residues 1-53)
CC   of telethonin, mediating the antiparallel assembly of two Z1Z2
CC   domains. The C-terminus of the telethonin appears to induce
CC   dimerisation of this 2:1 titin/telethonin structure which thus
CC   forms a complex necessary for myofibril assembly and maintenance
CC   of the intact Z-disk of skeletal and cardiac muscles [1].

AC   PF12009.2
DE   Telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex - RNA binding domain
CC   Telomeres in most organisms are comprised of tandem simple
CC   sequence repeats [1]. The total length of telomeric repeat
CC   sequence at each chromosome end is determined in a balance of
CC   sequence loss and sequence addition [1]. One major influence on
CC   telomere length is the enzyme telomerase [1]. It is a reverse
CC   transcriptase that adds these simple sequence repeats to
CC   chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA
CC   component of the enzyme [1]. The RNA binding domain of
CC   telomerase - TRBD - is made up of twelve alpha helices and two
CC   short beta sheets [2]. How telomerase and associated regulatory
CC   factors physically interact and function with each other to
CC   maintain appropriate telomere length is poorly understood. It is
CC   known however that TRBD is involved in formation of the
CC   holoenzyme (which performs the telomere extension) in addition
CC   to recognition and binding of RNA [2].
AC   PF11509.2
DE   Protection of telomeres protein POT1
CC   POT1 suppresses unwanted DNA repair activities at telomeres by
CC   binding the single-stranded G-rich DNA overhangs at human
CC   chromosome ends [1]. TPP1, a binding partner of POT1, along with
CC   POT1 forms a complex with telomeric DNA that increases the
CC   activity and processivity of the human telomerase core enzyme
CC   [1].These proteins serve as a processivity factor for telomerase
CC   during telomere extension [1].

DE   Telomeric single stranded DNA binding POT1/CDC13
CC   This domain binds single stranded telomeric DNA and adopts an OB
CC   fold [1].  It includes the proteins POT1 and CDC13 which have
CC   been shown to regulate telomere length, replication and capping
CC   [2-4].
AC   PF12658.1
DE   Telomere capping
CC   Stn1 and Ten1 are DNA-binding proteins with specificity for
CC   telomeric DNA substrates and both protect chromosome termini
CC   from unregulated resection and regulate telomere length. Stn1
CC   complexes with Ten1 and Cdc13 to function as a telomere-specific
CC   replication protein A (RPA)-like complex [1]. These three
CC   interacting proteins associate with the telomeric overhang in
CC   budding yeast, whereas a single protein known as Pot1
CC   (protection of telomeres-1) performs this function in fission
CC   yeast, and a two-subunit complex consisting of POT1 and TPP1
CC   associates with telomeric ssDNA in humans. S.pombe has Stn1- and
CC   Ten1-like proteins that are essential for chromosome end
CC   protection. Stn1 orthologues exist in all species that have
CC   Pot1, whereas Ten1-like proteins can be found in all fungi.
CC   Fission yeast Stn1 and Ten1 localise at telomeres in a manner
CC   that correlates with the length of the ssDNA overhang,
CC   suggesting that they specifically associate with the telomeric
CC   ssDNA. Two separate protein complexes are required for
CC   chromosome end protection in fission yeast. Protection of
CC   telomeres by multiple proteins with OB-fold domains is conserved
CC   in eukaryotic evolution [2].

DE   TENA/THI-4/PQQC family
CC   Members of this family are found in all the three major phyla of

CC   subtilis, TENA is one of a number of proteins that enhance the
CC   expression of extracellular enzymes, such as alkaline protease,
CC   neutral protease and levansucrase [1].  The THI-4 protein, which
CC   is involved in thiamine biosynthesis, is also a member of this

CC   significant sequence similarity to TENA proteins. This
CC   similarity was first noted with the Neurospora crassa THI-4 [2].

CC   prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes,including methanol
CC   dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of

DE   Tenuivirus movement protein
CC   This family of ssRNA negative-strand crop plant tenuivirus
CC   proteins appears to combine PV2 [1], NS2 [2], NS3, and PV3
CC   proteins. Plant viruses encode specific proteins known as
CC   movement proteins (MPs) to control their spread through
CC   plasmodesmata (PD) in walls between cells as well as from leaf
CC   to leaf via vascular-dependent transport.  During this movement
CC   process, the virally encoded MPs interact with viral genomes for
CC   transport from the viral replication sites to the PDs in the
CC   walls of infected cells along the cytoskeleton and/or
CC   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. The virus is then thought to
CC   move through the PDs in the form of MP-associated

DE   Chloroplast import component protein (Tic20)
CC   Chloroplast function requires the import of nuclear encoded
CC   proteins from the cytoplasm across the chloroplast double
CC   membrane. This is accomplished by two protein complexes, the Toc
CC   complex located at the outer membrane and the Tic complex
CC   located at the inner membrane. The Toc complex recognises
CC   specific proteins by a cleavable N-terminal sequence and is
CC   primarily responsible for translocation through the outer
CC   membrane, while the Tic complex translocates the protein through
CC   the inner membrane. This entry represents Tic20, a core member
CC   of the Tic complex. This protein is deeply embedded in the inner

CC   Tim44 is an essential component of the machinery that mediates
CC   the translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins across the
CC   mitochondrial inner membrane [1].  Tim44 is thought to bind
CC   phospholipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane both by
CC   electrostatic interactions and by penetrating the polar head
CC   group region [1].  This family includes the C-terminal region of
CC   Tim44 that has been shown to form a stable proteolytic fragment
CC   in yeast.  This region is also found in a set of smaller
CC   bacterial proteins. The molecular function of the bacterial
CC   members of this family is unknown but transport seems likely.

AC   PF11711.2
DE   Inner membrane protein import complex subunit Tim54
CC   Mitochondrial function depends on the import of hundreds of
CC   different proteins synthesised in the cytosol. Protein import is
CC   a multi-step pathway which includes the binding of precursor
CC   proteins to surface receptors, translocation of the precursor
CC   across one or both mitochondrial membranes, and folding and
CC   assembly of the imported protein inside the mitochondrion. Most
CC   precursor proteins carry amino-terminal targeting signals,
CC   called pre-sequences, and are imported into mitochondria via
CC   import complexes located in both the outer and the inner
CC   membrane (IM). The IM complex, TIM, is made up of at least two
CC   proteins which mediate translocation of proteins into the matrix
CC   by removing their signal peptide and another pair of proteins,
CC   Tim54 and Tim22, that insert the polytopic proteins, that carry
CC   internal targetting information, into the inner membrane [1].

CC   Drosophila TIM, but is the likely orthologue of a fly gene,
CC   timeout (also called tim-2) [1]. mTim has been shown to be

DE   TIP49 C-terminus
CC   This family consists of the C-terminal region of several
CC   eukaryotic and archaeal RuvB-like 1 (Pontin or TIP49a) and
CC   RuvB-like 2 (Reptin or TIP49b) proteins. The N-terminal domain
CC   contains the Pfam:PF00004 domain. In zebrafish, the liebeskummer
CC   (lik) mutation, causes development of hyperplastic embryonic
CC   hearts. lik encodes Reptin, a component of a DNA-stimulated
CC   ATPase complex. Beta-catenin and Pontin, a DNA-stimulated ATPase
CC   that is often part of complexes with Reptin, are in the same
CC   genetic pathways. The Reptin/Pontin ratio serves to regulate
CC   heart growth during development, at least in part via the
CC   beta-catenin pathway [1]. TBP-interacting protein 49 (TIP49) was
CC   originally identified as a TBP-binding protein, and two related

DE   Translocated intimin receptor (Tir) C-terminus
CC   Intimin and its translocated intimin receptor (Tir) are
CC   bacterial proteins that mediate adhesion between mammalian cells

DE   Transducer of regulated CREB activity, C terminus
CC   This family includes the C terminal region of TORC proteins.
CC   TORC (Transducer of regulated CREB activity) is a protein family
CC   of coactivators that enhances the activity of CRE-depended
CC   transcription via a phosphorylation-independent interaction with

CC   as fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain of GAL4
CC   (GAL4-BD), and tested for induction of a minimal promoter linked

DE   Transducer of regulated CREB activity, N terminus
CC   This family includes the N terminal region of TORC proteins.
CC   TORC (Transducer of regulated CREB activity) is a protein family
CC   of coactivators that enhances the activity of CRE-depended

CC   consensus sequence (RKXS) [1]. The coiled-coil structure
CC   interacts with the bZIP domain of CREB [2]. This interaction may
CC   occur via ionic bonds because it is disrupted under high-salt
CC   conditions [3]. In addition to CREB-binding, the N-terminal

CC   Torsion dystonia is an autosomal dominant movement disorder

CC   The members of this family resemble neurotoxin B-IV
CC   (Swiss:P01525), which is a crustacean-selective neurotoxin
CC   produced by the marine worm Cerebratulus lacteus. This highly
CC   cationic peptide is approximately 55 residues and is arranged to
CC   form two antiparallel helices connected by a well-defined loop
CC   in a hairpin structure. The branches of the hairpin are linked
CC   by four disulphide bonds. Three residues identified as being
CC   important for activity, namely Arg-17, -25 and -34, are found on
CC   the same face of the molecule, while another residue important
CC   for activity, Trp30, is on the opposite side. The protein's mode
CC   of action is not entirely understood, but it may act on

CC   Alpha-A conotoxin PIVA (Swiss:P55963) is the major paralytic

CC   the peptide is described as an "iron" with a highly charged 
CC   hydrophilic loop of 15S-19R forming the "handle" domain that	is
CC   exposed to the exterior of the protein. The stability of  the

DE   Toxin with inhibitor cystine knot ICK or Knottin scaffold
CC   Spider toxins of the CSTX family are ion channel toxins
CC   containing an inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) structural motif or
CC   Knottin scaffold. The four disulfide bonds present in the CSTX
CC   spider toxin family are arranged in the following pattern: 1-4,
CC   2-5, 3-8 and 6-7. CSTX-1 is the most important component of C.
CC   salei venom in terms of relative abundance and toxicity and
CC   therefore is likely to contribute significantly to the overall
CC   toxicity of the whole venom. CSTX-1 blocked rat neuronal L-type,
CC   but no other types of HVA Cav channels [3]. Interestingly, the
CC   omega-toxins from Phoneutria nigriventer venom (another South
CC   American species also belonging to the Ctenidae family) are
CC   included as they carry the same disulfide bond arrangement.

DE   TRA-1 regulated protein R03H10.4
CC   This family of proteins represents the protein product of the
CC   gene R03H10.4 which is located near a sequence that matches the
CC   TRA-1 binding consensus. TRA-1 is a transcription factor which
CC   controls sexual differentiation in C.elegans. R03H10.4 shows

DE   TraA
CC   Conjugative transfer of a bacteriocin plasmid, pPD1, of
CC   Enterococcus faecalis is induced in response to a peptide sex
CC   pheromone, cPD1, secreted from plasmid-free recipient cells.
CC   cPD1 is taken up by a pPD1 donor cell and binds to an
CC   intracellular receptor, TraA. Once a recipient cell acquires
CC   pPD1, it starts to produce an inhibitor of cPD1, termed iPD1,
CC   which functions as a TraA antagonist and blocks self-induction
CC   in donor cells. TraA transduces the signal of cPD1 to the mating
CC   response [1].
AC   PF01963.11
DE   TraB family
CC   pAD1 is a hemolysin/bacteriocin plasmid originally identified in
CC   Enterococcus faecalis DS16. It encodes a mating response to a
CC   peptide sex pheromone, cAD1, secreted by recipient bacteria.
CC   Once the plasmid pAD1 is acquired, production of the pheromone
CC   ceases--a trait related in part to a determinant designated
CC   traB. However a related protein is found in C. elegans
CC   Swiss:Q94217, suggesting that members of the TraB family have
CC   some more general function. This family also includes the
CC   bacterial GumN protein. The family has a conserved GXXH motif
CC   close to the N-terminus, a conserved glutamate and a conserved
CC   arginine that may be catalytic. The family also includes a
CC   second conserved GXXH motif near the C-terminus.
AC   PF07820.6
DE   TraC-like protein
CC   The members of this family are sequences that are similar to
CC   TraC (Swiss:Q84HT8). The gene encoding this protein is one of a
CC   group of genes found on plasmid p42a of Rhizobium etli CFN42
CC   that are thought to be involved in the process of plasmid
CC   self-transmission. Mobilisation of plasmid p42a is of importance
CC   as it is required for transfer of plasmid p42a, which is also
CC   known as plasmid pSym as it carries most of the genes required
CC   for nodulation and nitrogen fixation by the symbiotic bacterium.
CC   The predicted protein products of p42a are similar to known
CC   transfer proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid pTiC58
CC   [1].

DE   F pilus assembly Type-IV secretion system for plasmid transfer
CC   This family of TraC proteins is conserved in Proteobacteria.
CC   TraC is a cytoplasmic, peripheral membrane protein and is one of
CC   the proteins encoded by the F transfer region of the conjugative
CC   plasmid that is required for the assembly of F pilin into the

CC   help establish the physical contact between donor and recipient
CC   cells involved in the conjugation process [1].

DE   TRADD, N-terminal domain
CC   The N terminal domain of 'Tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1
CC   associated death domain protein' (TRADD) folds into an
CC   alpha-beta sandwich with a four-stranded beta sheet and six
CC   alpha helices, each forming one layer of the structure. The
CC   domain allows docking of TRADD onto 'tumour necrosis factor
CC   receptor-associated factor' (TRAF): the binding is at the
CC   beta-sandwich domain, away from the coiled-coil domain. Binding
CC   ensures the recruitment of cIAPs to the signaling complex, which
CC   may be important for direct caspase-8 inhibition and the
CC   immediate suppression of apoptosis at the apical point of the

DE   TraE protein
CC   This family consists of several bacterial sex pilus assembly and
CC   synthesis proteins (TraE). Conjugal transfer of plasmids from
CC   donor to recipient  cells is a complex process in which a
CC   cell-to-cell contact plays a key role. Many genes encoded by
CC   self-transmissible plasmids are required for various processes
CC   of conjugation, including pilus formation, stabilisation of

DE   TraM recognition site of TraD and TraG
CC   This family includes both TraG and TraD as well as VirD4
CC   proteins. TraG is essential for DNA transfer in bacterial
CC   conjugation.	These proteins are thought to mediate interactions
CC   between the DNA-processing (Dtr) and the mating pair formation
CC   (Mpf) systems [1]. This domain interacts with the relaxosome
CC   component TraM via the latter's tetramerisation domain. TraD is

CC   to be essential for DNA transfer in the process of conjugation,
CC   with the N-terminal portion being required for F pilus assembly
CC   [1,2]. The protein is thought to interact with the periplasmic

DE   Ebola virus-specific transcription factor VP30
CC   VP30 is a nucleocapsid-associated Ebola virus-specific
CC   transcription factor [1]. It acts by stabilising nascent mRNA in
CC   Ebola virus replication. The C terminal domain of VP30 folds
CC   into a dimeric helical assembly. VP30 assembles into hexamers in

AC   PF01841.1
DE   Transglutaminase-like superfamily
CC   This family includes animal transglutaminases and other

CC   this superfamily primarily involves three motifs that centre
CC   around conserved cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues
CC   that form the catalytic triad in the structurally characterised

CC   act as the acyl donors. The MTG molecule forms a single, compact
CC   domain belonging to the alpha+beta folding class, containing 11
CC   alpha-helices and 8 beta-strands. The alpha-helices and the

CC   (TRAP) complex consisting of 4 protein subunits. The association
CC   of mature proteins with the ER and Golgi, or other intracellular

DE   Telomere repeat binding factor (TRF)
CC   Telomere repeat binding factor (TRF) family proteins are
CC   important for the regulation of telomere stability. The two
CC   related human TRF proteins hTRF1 and hTRF2 form homodimers and
CC   bind directly to telomeric TTAGGG repeats via the myb DNA
CC   binding domain Pfam:PF00249 at the carboxy terminus [1]. TRF1 is
CC   implicated in telomere length regulation and TRF2 in telomere
CC   protection [1]. Other telomere complex associated proteins are
CC   recruited through their interaction with either TRF1 or TRF2.
CC   The fission yeast protein Taz1p (telomere-associated in
CC   Schizosaccharomyces pombe) has similarity to both hTRF1 and
CC   hTRF2 and may perform the dual functions of TRF1 and TRF2 at
CC   fission yeast telomeres [2]. This domain is composed of multiple

AC   PF11611.2
DE   Telomeric repeat-binding factor 2
CC   Telomeres are gene-poor, repetitive chromosomal regions that are

CC   telomere repeat binding factors 1 and 2, TRF1 and TRF2 (also
CC   known as TERF1 and TERF2), which can directly bind to the TTAGGG
CC   repeats and can also interact with other factors, forming large
CC   protein complexes that regulate telomere length and function.
CC   The TRF2 complex has a fundamental role in protecting the
CC   telomeric single-stranded G-rich overhang from degradation and
CC   from DNA repair activities, thereby preventing telomere
CC   end-to-end fusions [1,2].

DE   TrfA protein
CC   This family consists of several bacterial TrfA proteins. The
CC   trfA operon of broad-host-range IncP plasmids is essential to
CC   activate the origin of vegetative replication in diverse

CC   highly conserved and encodes a putative single-stranded DNA
CC   binding protein (Ssb). The second, trfA, contains two
CC   translational starts as in the IncP alpha plasmids, generating
CC   related polypeptides of 406 (TrfA1) and 282 (TrfA2) amino acids.
CC   TrfA2 is very similar to the IncP alpha product, whereas the
CC   N-terminal region of TrfA1 shows very little similarity to the
CC   equivalent region of IncP alpha TrfA1. This region has been
CC   implicated in the ability of IncP alpha plasmids to replicate
CC   efficiently in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [1].

CC   and/or neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS).
CC   This interpretation is supported by the identification of a
CC   peptidase localised on the surface of neuronal cells which has
CC   been termed TRH-degrading ectoenzyme (TRH-DE) since it
CC   selectively inactivates TRH [1]. TRH has been used clinically

DE   tRNA (Uracil-5-)-methyltransferase
CC   This family consists of (Uracil-5-)-methyltransferases
CC   EC:2.1.1.35 from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. A
CC   5-methyluridine (m(5)U) residue at position 54 is a conserved
CC   feature of bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs. The methylation of
CC   U54 is catalysed by the tRNA(m5U54)methyltransferase, which in
CC   Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the nonessential TRM2
CC   gene. It is thought that tRNA modification enzymes might have a
CC   role in tRNA maturation not necessarily linked to their known
CC   catalytic activity [1].

DE   Tropomodulin
CC   Tropomodulin is a novel tropomyosin regulatory protein that
CC   binds to the end of erythrocyte tropomyosin and blocks
CC   head-to-tail association of tropomyosin along actin filaments
CC   [1]. Limited proteolysis shows this protein is composed of two
CC   domains [2]. The amino terminal domain contains the tropomyosin
CC   binding function [2].

DE   Tropomyosin
AC   PF12718.1
DE   Tropomyosin like
CC   This family is a set of eukaryotic tropomyosins. Within the
CC   yeast Tmp1 and Tmp2, biochemical and sequence analyses indicate
CC   that Tpm2p spans four actin monomers along a filament, whereas
CC   Tpmlp spans five.  Despite its shorter length, Tpm2p can compete
CC   with Tpm1p for binding to F-actin. Over-expression of Tpm2p in
CC   vivo alters the axial budding of haploids to a bipolar pattern,
CC   and this can be partially suppressed by co-over-expression of
CC   Tpm1p. This suggests distinct functions for the two
CC   tropomyosins, and indicates that the ratio between them is
CC   important for correct morphogenesis [1]. The family also
CC   contains higher eukaryote Tmp3 members.

CC   contains members of the TnT subunit. Troponin is a complex of
CC   three proteins, Ca2+ binding (TnC), inhibitory (TnI), and
CC   tropomyosin binding (TnT).  The troponin complex regulates Ca++
CC   induced muscle contraction. This family includes troponin T and
CC   troponin I.  Troponin I binds to actin and troponin T binds to
CC   tropomyosin.

DE   Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel
CC   This family of proteins are transient receptor potential (TRP)
CC   ion channels. 	 They are essential for cellular viability
CC   and are involved in cell growth and cell wall synthesis [1].

DE   Transient receptor ion channel II
CC   This domain is found in the transient receptor ion channel (Trp)
CC   family of proteins.  There is strong evidence that Trp proteins
CC   are structural elements of calcium-ion entry channels activated
CC   by G protein-coupled receptors [1].  This domain does not tend
CC   to appear with the TRP domain (Pfam:PF06011) but is often found

CC   dimethylallyltransferase (EC:2.5.1.34), which catalyses the
CC   first step of ergot alkaloid biosynthesis [1]. Ergot alkaloids,
CC   which are produced by endophyte fungi, can enhance plant host
CC   fitness, but also cause livestock toxicosis to host plants. This
CC   protein is found in bacteria and eukaryotes. Proteins in this

CC   [1].
AC   PF08055.5
DE   Tryptophan leader peptide
CC   This family consists of the tryptophan (trp) leader peptides.
CC   Tryptophan accumulation is the principal event resulting in
CC   downregulation of transcription of the structural genes of the
CC   trp operon. The leader peptide of the trp operon forms mutually
CC   exclusive secondary structures that would either result in the
CC   termination of transcription of the trp operon when tryptophan
CC   is in plentiful supply or vice versa [1].

DE   Tryptophan operon leader peptide
CC   This family consists of the tryptophan operon  leader peptides.
CC   The tryptophan operon is regulated  by transcription attenuation
CC   in response to changes  in the level of tryptophan. The
CC   transcript of the  leader peptide can adopt alternative

DE   TRAPP trafficking subunit Trs65
CC   This family is one of the subunits of the TRAPP Golgi
CC   trafficking complex [1]. TRAPP subunits are found in two
CC   different sized complexes, TRAPP I and TRAPP II. While both
CC   complexes contain the same seven subunits, Bet3p, Bet5p, Trs20p,
CC   Trs23p, Trs31p, Trs33p and Trs85p, with TRAPPC human
CC   equivalents, TRAPP II has the additional three subunits ,Trs65p,
CC   Trs120p and Trs130p [3]. While it has been implicated in cell
CC   wall biogenesis and stress response, the role of Trs65 in TRAPP
CC   II is supported by the findings that the protein co-localises
CC   with Trs130p, and deletion of TRS65 in yeast leads to a
CC   conditional lethal phenotype if either one of the other TRAPP
CC   II-specific subunits is modified [4]. Furthermore, the trs65
CC   mutant has reduced Ypt31/32p guanine nucleotide exchange, GEF,
CC   activity [3].

CC   contains a central channel running from the cytosolic pole (made
CC   up by the AADs) to the membrane pole ending at the transmembrane
CC   pore shaped by 12 transmembrane helices, rendering an overall
CC   mushroom-like structure. The TrwB_AAD (all-alpha domain) domain
CC   appears to be the DNA-binding domain of the structure. TrwB, a

CC   in both Drosophila and vertebrates by forming a tripartite
CC   complete between itself, SOG/chordin and a BMP ligand; Tsg seems
CC   to enhance the Tld/BMP-1-mediated cleavage rate of SOG/chordin

DE   TspO/MBR family
CC   Tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) is an integral membrane
CC   protein that acts as a negative regulator of the expression of
CC   specific photosynthesis genes in response to oxygen/light [1].
CC   It is involved in the efflux of porphyrin intermediates from the
CC   cell. This reduces the activity of coproporphyrinogen III
CC   oxidase, which is thought to lead to the accumulation of a
CC   putative repressor molecule that inhibits the expression of
CC   specific photosynthesis genes. Several conserved aromatic
CC   residues are necessary for TspO function: they are thought to be
CC   involved in binding porphyrin intermediates [3]. In [2], the rat
CC   mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (MBR) was shown
CC   to not only retain its structure within a bacterial outer
CC   membrane, but also to be able to functionally substitute for
CC   TspO in TspO- mutants, and to act in a similar manner to TspO in
CC   its in situ location: the outer mitochondrial membrane. The
CC   biological significance of MBR remains unclear, however. It is

DE   Tubulin-tyrosine ligase family
CC   Tubulins and microtubules are subjected to several
CC   post-translational modifications of which the reversible
CC   detyrosination/tyrosination of the carboxy-terminal end of most
CC   alpha-tubulins has been extensively analysed. This modification
CC   cycle involves a specific carboxypeptidase and the activity of
CC   the tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) [2]. The true physiological
CC   function of TTL has so far not been established.
CC   Tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) catalyses the ATP-dependent
CC   post-translational addition of a tyrosine to the carboxy
CC   terminal end of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. In normally cycling
CC   cells, the tyrosinated form of tubulin predominates. However, in
CC   breast cancer cells, the detyrosinated form frequently
CC   predominates, with a correlation to tumour aggressiveness [3].
CC   On the other hand, 3-nitrotyrosine has been shown to be
CC   incorporated, by TTL, into the carboxy terminal end of
CC   detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. This reaction is not reversible by
CC   the carboxypeptidase enzyme. Cells cultured in 3-nitrotyrosine

DE   Macrocin-O-methyltransferase (TylF)
CC   This family consists of bacterial macrocin O-methyltransferase
CC   (TylF) proteins. TylF is responsible for the methylation of
CC   macrocin to produce tylosin. Tylosin is a macrolide antibiotic
CC   used in veterinary medicine to treat infections caused by
CC   Gram-positive bacteria and as an animal growth promoter in the
CC   swine industry. It is produced by several Streptomyces species.
CC   As with other macrolides, the antibiotic activity of tylosin is
CC   due to the inhibition of protein biosynthesis by a mechanism
CC   that involves the binding of tylosin to the ribosome, preventing
CC   the formation of the mRNA-aminoacyl-tRNA-ribosome complex [1].
CC   The structure of one representative sequence from this family,
CC   NovP, shows it to be an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent
CC   O-methyltransferase that catalyses the penultimate step in the
CC   biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin.
CC   Specifically, it methylates at 4-OH of the noviose moiety, and
CC   the resultant methoxy group is important for the potency of the
CC   mature antibiotic. It is likely that the key structural features
CC   of NovP are common to the rest of the family and include: a
CC   helical 'lid' region that gates access to the co-substrate
CC   binding pocket and an active centre that contains a 3-Asp
CC   putative metal binding site. A further conserved Asp probably
CC   acts as the general base that initiates the reaction by
CC   de-protonating the 4-OH group of the noviose unit [2].

DE   Myosin-binding striated muscle assembly central
CC   The UNC-45 or small muscle protein 1 of C.elegans is expressed
CC   in two forms from different genomic positions in mammals, as a
CC   general tissue protein UNC-45a and a specific form Unc-45b
CC   expressed only in striated and skeletal muscle. All members
CC   carry up to three amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)
CC   domains towards their N-terminal, a UCS domain at the C-terminal
CC   that contains a number of Arm repeats Pfam:PF00514 and this
CC   central region of approximately 400 residues. Both the general
CC   form and the muscle form of UNC-45 function in myotube formation
CC   through cell fusion. Myofibril formation requires both GC and SM
CC   UNC-45, consistent with the fact that the cytoskeleton is
CC   necessary for the development and maintenance of organised
CC   myofibrils [1]. The S. pombe Rng3p, is crucial for cell shape,
CC   normal actin cytoskeleton, and contractile ring assembly, and is
CC   essential for assembly of the myosin II-containing progenitors
CC   of the contractile ring. Widespread defects in the cytoskeleton
CC   are found in null mutants of all three fungal proteins [2].
CC   Mammalian Unc45 is found to act as a specific chaperone during

CC   The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
CC   expressed in the absence of other viral components causes many
CC   of the cytopathic effects of VSV, including an inhibition of
CC   host gene expression and the induction of cell rounding. It has
CC   been shown that M protein also induces apoptosis in the absence
CC   of other viral components. It is thought that the activation of
CC   apoptotic pathways causes the inhibition of host gene expression
CC   and cell rounding by M protein [1].

DE   Mysoin-binding motif of peroxisomes
CC   Vezatin is a peroxisome transmembrane receptor that is involved
CC   in membrane-membrane and cell-cell adhesions. In the movement of
CC   peroxisomes it binds to class V [2] and class VIIa [3] myosins
CC   to guide the organelle through the microtubules [2] and allow
CC   pathogens to internalise themselves into host cells [1]. Vezatin
CC   is crucial for spermatozoan production [3]. In mouse cells it
CC   interacts with the cadherin-catenin complex bridging it to the
CC   C-terminal FERM domain of myosin VIIA [4].

CC   The beta subunit of voltage gated calcium channels is coded for
CC   by four genes 1-4. Gene 4 can produce two types of beta4A domain
CC   (beta4Aa and beta4Ab) according to how the gene splicing is
CC   carried out. This family is part of the beta4Aa N terminal
CC   domain. It is made up of an alpha helix and a beta strand. It is
CC   thought to regulate the channel properties through
CC   protein-protein interactions with non Ca channel proteins. [1]

DE   Vestigial/Tondu family
CC   The mammalian TEF and the Drosophila scalloped genes belong to a
CC   conserved family of transcriptional factors that possesses a
CC   TEA/ATTS DNA-binding domain. Transcriptional activation by these
CC   proteins likely requires interactions with specific
CC   coactivators. In Drosophila, Scalloped (Sd) interacts with
CC   Vestigial (Vg) to form a complex, which binds DNA through the Sd
CC   TEA/ATTS domain. The Sd-Vg heterodimer is a key regulator of
CC   wing development, which directly controls several target genes
CC   and is able to induce wing outgrowth when ectopically expressed.
CC   This short conserved region is needed for interaction with Sd
CC   [1].

CC   This family consists of several bacterial VirC1 proteins. In
CC   Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a cis-active 24-base-pair sequence
CC   adjacent to the right border of the T-DNA, called overdrive,
CC   stimulates tumour formation by increasing the level of T-DNA
CC   processing. It is thought that the virC operon which enhances
CC   T-DNA processing probably does so because the VirC1 protein
CC   interacts with overdrive. It has now been shown that the virC1
CC   gene product binds to overdrive but not to the right border of
CC   T-DNA [1]. 
AC   PF07181.5

DE   T-DNA border endonuclease VirD1
CC   This family consists of several T-DNA border endonuclease VirD1
CC   proteins which appear to be found exclusively in Agrobacterium
CC   species. Agrobacterium, a plant pathogen, is capable to stably
CC   transform the plant cell with a segment of its own DNA called
CC   T-DNA (transferred DNA). This process depends, among others, on
CC   the specialised bacterial virulence proteins VirD1 and VirD2
CC   that excise the T-DNA from its adjacent sequences. VirD1 is
CC   thought to interact with VirD2 in this process [1].

CC   Agrobacteria. VirE1 competes for the ssDNA binding site of
CC   VirE2.
AC   PF07229.6
DE   VirE2
CC   This family consists of several VirE2 proteins which seem to be
CC   specific to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Rhizobium etli. VirE2
CC   is known to interact, via its C terminus, with VirD4.
CC   Agrobacterium tumefaciens transfers oncogenic DNA and effector
CC   proteins to plant cells during the course of infection.
CC   Substrate translocation across the bacterial cell envelope is
CC   mediated by a type IV secretion (TFS) system composed of the
CC   VirB proteins, as well as VirD4, a member of a large family of
CC   inner membrane proteins implicated in the coupling of DNA
CC   transfer intermediates to the secretion machine. VirE2 is
CC   therefore thought to be a protein substrate of a type IV
CC   secretion system which is recruited to a member of the coupling
CC   protein superfamily [1]. 
AC   PF06661.5
DE   VirE3
CC   This family represents a conserved region within Agrobacterium
CC   tumefaciens VirE3. Agrobacterium tumefaciens (a plant pathogen)
CC   has a tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid of which part, the transfer
CC   (T)-region, is transferred to plant cells during the infection
CC   process. Vir proteins mediate the processing of the T-region and
CC   the transfer of a single-stranded (ss) DNA copy of this region,
CC   the T-strand, into the recipient cells. VirE3 is a translocated
CC   effector protein, but its specific role has not been established

DE   Bacterial virulence protein (VirJ)
CC   This family consists of several bacterial VirJ virulence
CC   proteins. VirJ is thought to be involved in the type IV
CC   secretion system. It is thought that the substrate proteins
CC   localised to the periplasm may associate with the pilus in a

CC   Using reduced vitamin K, oxygen, and carbon dioxide,
CC   gamma-glutamyl  carboxylase post-translationally modifies
CC   certain glutamates by adding carbon dioxide to the gamma

DE   Viral methyltransferase
CC   This RNA methyltransferase domain [1] is found in a wide range
CC   of ssRNA viruses, including Hordei-, Tobra-, Tobamo-, Bromo-,
CC   Clostero- and Caliciviruses.	This methyltransferase is involved
CC   in mRNA capping.  Capping of mRNA enhances its stability. This
CC   usually occurs in the nucleus.  Therefore, many viruses that
CC   replicate in the cytoplasm encode their own [1].  This is a
CC   specific guanine-7-methyltransferase domain involved in viral
CC   mRNA cap0 synthesis. Specificity for guanine 7 position is shown
CC   by NMR in [3] and in vivo role in cap synthesis [4].	Based on

DE   Vps51/Vps67
CC   This family includes a presumed domain found in a number of
CC   components of vesicular transport.  The VFT tethering complex
CC   (also known as GARP complex, Golgi associated retrograde protein
CC   complex, Vps53 tethering complex) is a conserved eukaryotic
CC   docking complex which is involved recycling of proteins from
CC   endosomes to the late Golgi .  Vps51 (also known as Vps67) is a
CC   subunit of VFT and interacts with the SNARE Tlg1 [1].  Cog1_N is
CC   the N-terminus of the Cog1 subunit of the eight-unit Conserved
CC   Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex that participates in retrograde
CC   vesicular transport and is required to maintain normal Golgi
CC   structure and function. The subunits are located in two lobes
CC   and Cog1 serves to bind the two lobes together probably via the

CC   [2].

CC   This family contains various proteins that are homologs of the
CC   yeast Vps54 protein, such as the rat homolog	(Swiss:Q9JMK8),
CC   the human homolog (Swiss:Q86YF7), and  the mouse homolog
CC   (Swiss:Q8R3X1). In yeast, Vps54 associates with Vps52 and Vps53
CC   proteins to form a trimolecular complex  that is involved in
CC   protein transport between Golgi, endosomal, and vacuolar
CC   compartments [1]. All Vps54 homologs contain a coiled coil

AC   PF12816.1
DE   Golgi CORVET complex core vacuolar protein 8
CC   Vps8 is one of the Golgi complex components necessary for
CC   vacuolar sorting [1]. Eukaryotic cells contain a highly dynamic
CC   endo-membrane system, in which individual organelles keep their
CC   identity despite continuous vesicle generation and fusion.
CC   Vesicles that bud from a donor membrane are targeted and
CC   delivered to each individual organelle, where they release their
CC   cargo after fusion with the acceptor membrane. Vps8 is the core
CC   component of the endosomal tethering complex CORVET (class C
CC   core vacuole/endosome tethering).  Vps8 co-operates with
CC   Vps21-GTP to mediate endosomal clustering in a reaction that is
CC   dependent on Vps3. Vps8 is the only CORVET subunit that is
CC   enriched on late endosomes, suggesting that it is a marker for
CC   the maturation of late endosomes. Late endosomes form
CC   intralumenal vesicles, and the resulting multivesicular bodies
CC   fuse with the vacuole to release their cargoes [2].

CC   has been suggested that RYK may also bind to Wnt [1]. The WIF
CC   domain is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and it
CC   comprises nine beta-strands and two alpha-helices, with two of
CC   the beta-strands (6 and 9) interrupted by four and six residues
CC   of irregular secondary structure, respectively. Considering that
CC   the activity of Wnts depends on the presence of a palmitoylated
CC   cysteine residue in their amino-terminal polypeptide segment,
CC   Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth
CC   factors, it is likely that the WIF domain recognises and binds
CC   to Wnts that have been activated by palmitoylation and that the
CC   recognition of palmitoylated Wnts by WIF-1 is effected by its
CC   WIF domain rather than by its EGF domains. A strong binding
CC   affinity for palmitoylated cysteine residues would further
CC   explain the remarkably high affinity of human WIF-1 not only for

CC   HX-C(P)X-C-X4-G-R motif by a variable region of usually 25-30
CC   (hydrophobic) residues. Although it belongs to one of the zinc
CC   finger's fold groups (zinc ribbon), this particular domain was
CC   first identified in LPS-induced tumour necrosis alpha factor
CC   (LITAF) which is produced in mammalian cells after being
CC   challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)[2]. The hydrophobic
CC   region probably inserts into the membrane rather than traversing
CC   it. Such an insertion brings together the N- and C-terminal
CC   C-XX-C motifs to form a compact Zn2+-binding structure [3].

DE   LSD1 zinc finger
CC   This family consists of several plant specific LSD1 zinc finger
CC   domains. Arabidopsis lsd1 mutants are hyper-responsive to cell
CC   death initiators and fail to limit the extent of cell death.
CC   Superoxide is a necessary and sufficient signal for cell death
CC   propagation. LSD1 monitors a superoxide-dependent signal and
CC   negatively regulates a plant cell death pathway. LSD1 protein
CC   contains three zinc finger domains, defined by
CC   CxxCxRxxLMYxxGASxVxCxxC. It has been suggested that LSD1 defines
CC   a zinc finger protein subclass and that LSD1 regulates
CC   transcription, via either repression of a pro-death pathway or
CC   activation of an anti-death pathway, in response to signals
CC   emanating from cells undergoing pathogen-induced hypersensitive
CC   cell death [1].

DE   Zinc-finger of C2H2 type
CC   This is a zinc-finger domain with the CxxCx(12)Hx(6)H motif,
CC   found in multiple copies in a wide range of proteins from plants
CC   to metazoans. Some member proteins, particularly those from
CC   plants, are annotated as being RNA-binding.

CC   has a zinc ribbon structure.
AC   PF05741.7
DE   Nanos RNA binding domain
CC   This family consists of several conserved novel zinc finger
CC   domains found in the eukaryotic proteins Nanos and Xcat-2. In
CC   Drosophila melanogaster, Nanos functions as a localised
CC   determinant of posterior pattern. Nanos RNA is localised to the
CC   posterior pole of the maturing egg cell and encodes a protein
CC   that emanates from this localised source. Nanos acts as a
CC   translational repressor and thereby establishes a gradient of
CC   the morphogen Hunchback [1]. Xcat-2 is found in the vegetal
CC   cortical region and is inherited by the vegetal blasomeres
CC   during development, and is degraded  very early in development.
CC   The localised and maternally restricted expression of Xcat-2 RNA
CC   suggests a role for its protein in setting up regional
CC   differences in gene expression that occur early in development
CC   [2]. 
AC   PF01422.11
DE   NF-X1 type zinc finger
CC   This domain is presumed to be a zinc binding domain. The
CC   following pattern describes the zinc finger.
CC   C-X(1-6)-H-X-C-X3-C(H/C)-X(3-4)-(H/C)-X(1-10)-C Where X can be
CC   any amino acid, and numbers in brackets indicate the number of
CC   residues. Two position can be either his or cys. This family
CC   includes Swiss:P40798, Swiss:Q12986 and Swiss:P53971. The zinc
CC   fingers in Swiss:Q12986 bind to DNA [1].
AC   PF05020.9
DE   NPL4 family, putative zinc binding region
CC   The HRD4 gene was identical to NPL4, a gene previously
CC   implicated in nuclear transport. Using a diverse set of
CC   substrates and direct ubiquitination assays, analysis revealed
CC   that HRD4/NPL4 is required for a poorly characterised step in
CC   ER-associated degradation after ubiquitination of target
CC   proteins but before their recognition by the 26S proteasome [1].
CC   This region of the protein contains possibly two zinc binding
CC   motifs (Bateman A pers. obs.). Npl4p physically associates with
CC   Cdc48p via Ufd1p to form a Cdc48p-Ufd1p-Npl4p complex. The
CC   Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 complex functions in the recognition of several
CC   polyubiquitin-tagged proteins and facilitates their presentation
CC   to the 26S proteasome for processive degradation or even more
CC   specific processing.
AC   PF11789.2
DE   Zinc-finger of the MIZ type in Nse subunit
CC   Nse1 and Nse2 are novel non-SMC subunits of the fission yeast
CC   Smc5-6 DNA repair complex. This family is the zinc-finger domain
CC   similar to the MIZ type of zinc-finger [1].

AC   PF13008.1
DE   Zinc-binding domain of Paramyxovirinae V protein
CC   The paramyxoviruses, which include such respiroviruses as
CC   para-influenzae and measles, produce phosphoproteins - protein P
CC   - that are integral to the polymerase transcription-replication
CC   complex. Protein P consists of two functionally distinct
CC   moieties, an N-terminal PNT, and a C-terminal PCT [1]. The P
CC   gene region transcribes proteins from all three ORFs, and the V
CC   protein consists of the PNT moiety and a more C-terminal
CC   2-zinc-binding domain. This conserved region consists of the
CC   two-zinc-binding section sandwiched between beta sheets 6 and 7
CC   of the overall V protein. It is the binding of this core domain
CC   of V protein with the DDB1 protein (part of the ubiquitin-ligase
CC   complex) of eukaryotes which represents the key element of the
CC   virus-host protein interaction [3]. In the Henipavirus family
CC   which includes Nipah and Hendra viruses, the V protein is able
CC   to block IFN (interferon) signalling by preventing IFN-induced
CC   STAT phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [2].  The P gene
CC   of morbillivirus is co-transcriptionally edited leading to a V
CC   protein being produced.
AC   PF00645.12
DE   Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA-Ligase Zn-finger region
CC   Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is an important regulatory component
CC   of the cellular response to DNA damage. The amino-terminal
CC   region of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase consists of two PARP-type
CC   zinc fingers.  This region acts as a DNA nick sensor.
AC   PF05715.7
DE   Piccolo Zn-finger

DE   Recombination-activating protein 1 zinc-finger domain
CC   This is a C2-H2 zinc-finger domain closely resembling the
CC   classical TFIIIA-type zinc-finger, CX3FX5LX2-3H, despite having
CC   a valine and a tyrosine at the core instead of a phenylalanine
CC   and a leucine, hence CX3VX1LX2YX2H.  The structure,
CC   nevertheless, contains the characteristic two-stranded
CC   beta-sheet and alpha-helix of a classical zinc-finger. The
CC   domain binds one zinc and, in complex with the zinc-RING-finger
CC   domain, helps to stabilise the whole of the dimerisation region
CC   of recombination activating protein 1 (RAG1) [1]. The function
CC   of the whole is to bind double-stranded DNA.

CC   cycle control [1].

DE   Sec23/Sec24 zinc finger
CC   COPII-coated vesicles carry proteins from the endoplasmic

CC   and the Sec13p/Sec31p complex. This domain is found to be zinc
CC   binding domain.

CC   methyltransferase proteins. It is presumed to be a zinc binding
CC   domain.
AC   PF06220.6
DE   U1 zinc finger
CC   This family consists of several U1 small nuclear
CC   ribonucleoprotein C (U1-C) proteins. The U1 small nuclear
CC   ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binds to the pre-mRNA 5' splice
CC   site (ss) at early stages of spliceosome assembly.  Recruitment
CC   of U1 to a class of weak 5' ss is promoted by binding of the
CC   protein TIA-1 to uridine-rich sequences immediately downstream
CC   from the 5' ss. Binding of TIA-1 in the vicinity of a 5' ss
CC   helps to stabilise U1 snRNP recruitment, at least in part, via a
CC   direct interaction with U1-C, thus providing one molecular
CC   mechanism for the function of this splicing regulator [1]. This
CC   domain is probably a zinc-binding.  It is found in multiple
CC   copies in some members of the family.

CC   in proteins that also contain an XS domain.
AC   PF03367.7
DE   ZPR1 zinc-finger domain
CC   The zinc-finger protein ZPR1 is ubiquitous among eukaryotes. It
CC   is indeed known to be an essential protein in yeast. In
CC   quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in
CC   proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens,
CC   ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the
CC   cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is
CC   thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of
CC   EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with
CC   EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to
CC   sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [1,2,3]. Upon stimulation by
CC   EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation
CC   factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes
CC   [1]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the
CC   nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha
CC   has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation
CC   [1], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA
CC   expression [2]. The ZPR1 domain consists of an elongation
CC   initiation factor 2-like zinc finger and a double-stranded beta
CC   helix with a helical hairpin insertion. ZPR1 binds
CC   preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly
CC   influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis
CC   [4]. The alignment for this family shows a domain of which there
CC   are two copies in ZPR1 proteins. This family also includes
CC   several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota
CC   and Euryarchaeota), which only contain one copy of the aligned
CC   region. This similarity between ZPR1 and archaeal proteins was
CC   not previously noted.

CC   been shown to activate transcription when fused to a GAL4 DNA
CC   binding domain [1].

CC   septal ring. The structure of this domain is an alpha-beta fold
CC   with three alpha helices and a beta sheet of six antiparallel
CC   beta strands. The major loops protruding from the beta sheet
CC   surface are thought to form a binding site for FtsZ [1].
